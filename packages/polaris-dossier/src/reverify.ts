/** The step guard every later command calls before it reads an object for the run (REQ-polaris-generation-033: "At every later
 * check, review check and render, Syzygy SHALL verify again that the recorded pinned revision is a revision the in-force observation
 * consent names, and SHALL refuse the step otherwise").
 *
 * `run.json` lies within the agent sessions' write reach, so nothing the guard decides rests on what it says beyond which revision,
 * repository and clone to look at, and the operator's agent provider. The provider is the operator's declaration and nothing live can
 * attest it, so it is read from the run record, and the per-project statement it selects is selected by that Inferred value
 * (R-POLARIS-DOSSIER-S3-GATES-2 finding 6). Once the run is briefed, a tool or provider that differs from the one the brief record
 * states refuses; the brief record lies within the same reach, so an edit of both records together is not detected, and the disclosure
 * says so. Where the clone lies is likewise whoever last wrote the run record's choice. Every gate is re-read now: the consent found by the URL must still be the one for the recorded
 * repository and must still name the pinned commit; the registry entry and the policy must still be in force by their acts. Only then
 * is the pinned tree listed, through the re-hashing reader from the recorded clone, and whether the subject is governed is decided again
 * from the project input in force now and that listing. The recomputed kind must equal the recorded one, and whenever the subject needs
 * a per-project statement, one must be in force now and be the one the run relies on, whatever the record says
 * (R-POLARIS-DOSSIER-S3-GATES-1 finding 1). So a pin moved to another consented revision that is governed, or a record edited down to
 * non-governed, refuses once the statement it would need is not in force.
 *
 * The consented revision's label and the consent record are returned as the live records give them, never from the run record: a
 * later step that shows which revision and which consent the run read shows these (finding 2). HEAD is never read again. Every failing
 * reason is reported, not only the first, each with a machine code beside its prose (finding 3). */
