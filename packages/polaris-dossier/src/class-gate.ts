/** The content-class gate on every artifact Syzygy hands an agent session (R-PR403-SCREEN-DOCS-1 finding 1).
 *
 * The screening policy's `publicSourceScope.prerequisite.consentRule` says "a consent record that does not list project-documentation does
 * not permit its egress, and no consent granted before the class existed is read as covering it (RFC5-14 as amended); this policy confers
 * no consent", and its `rawBodyHandling.rule` permits "external egress only for content this scope classifies and only under a separate
 * egress consent for the pair". Screening admits a body; it does not consent to sending it. So a span enters the fidelity packet, or the
 * rendered site the design packet carries, only when the class the screen admitted its path under is listed by the per-project provider
 * statement the run relies on (`OpenedRun.contentClasses`, re-read at this step by `reverify.ts`). Otherwise it is withheld with the
 * class no consent lists, never dropped silently.
 *
 * The population, swept over every consumer of the screen's `screenPath` and `screenBody` in this package: the fidelity packet
 * (`review.ts`, `buildFidelityPacket`, gated here); the rendered site (`render.ts`, `buildLocalInput`, gated here), which the design
 * packet (`design-review.ts`) carries whole; `session-handover.ts`, which copies only those two packets into a review session; the
 * check derivation (`check.ts`, `deriveFindings`), local quotation verification whose findings and records carry byte ranges and no
 * source text, so it sends nothing; and `close.ts`, which runs the detectors over the run's own values and reads no blob.
 *
 * Where the policy is silent, fail closed: a run that relies on no statement (a non-governed subject, REQ-polaris-generation-033) has
 * no consent record listing project-documentation, so that class is withheld from it; code-content keeps the posture it had before
 * the class existed, which this gate does not change. A path the screen admits under no class is withheld too. */
