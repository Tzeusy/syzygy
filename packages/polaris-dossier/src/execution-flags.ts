/** The flags on the agent's reported commands where execution was permitted (REQ-polaris-generation-033 as of v1.1, N6).
 *
 * A permitting brief asks, for every command, the working directory it ran in and whether it falls within the scope the owner's choice
 * names. The draft is admitted whether or not a command carries them. Syzygy flags, as a finding disclosed beside the command and
 * labelled Inferred, each command whose reported working directory lies outside the clone, that reports none, or that the agent states
 * falls outside that scope. A flag refuses no step and hides no command: under D9, SEC-3 governs what Syzygy does about the session,
 * not what the session does. Every input is the agent's self-report, so a command without a flag is not shown to lie within the clone
 * or the scope either; it is only not flagged.
 *
 * "Outside the clone" is decided lexically: the reported directory, normalised, against the clone's real path the run record names.
 * Syzygy reads no file system for it, so a link inside the clone that leads elsewhere is not seen, and a directory that is not an
 * absolute path cannot be placed within the clone and is flagged as such. Under SEC-3's rule nothing is permitted and nothing is
 * flagged; a brief record that cannot be read counts as permitting, so the flags fail toward being shown. */
