Usage: syzygy dossier <command> [--json] [arguments]

Commands:
  preflight <url>     report whether the observation consent, the source-acquisition
                      registry entry and the classification and screening policy are
                      in force for the repository, the revisions the consent names,
                      any per-project statement, and whether D9 and the RFC7-20
                      reading are in force; the URL is parsed, never fetched
  init <clone> --url <url> --config <run.json> [--state-root <dir>]
                      check the start gates, pin the clone's HEAD to a consented
                      revision, decide whether the subject is governed, and make the
                      run directory under the state root (or $${STATE_ROOT_ENV});
                      there is no default state root
  brief <run>         re-verify the pinned revision and issue the authoring brief
                      (brief.md) and the draft schema (draft.schema.json) in the run
                      directory, starting the deadline clock; a run is briefed once.
                      The brief carries SEC-3's execution rule, quoted from the
                      adopted security.md
  allow-execution <run> --revision <pinned> --declare owner-started-session,owners-own-host,owner-attends
                      record the owner's execution choice for this one run and its
                      pinned revision, with the operator's three declarations; run it
                      personally, never through an agent. Refused while D9 is not in
                      force, after the brief, or for another run or revision. It is
                      not an execution consent and approves no execution profile
  check <run> [--draft <file>]
                      re-verify the pinned revision, refuse past the deadline or the
                      repair-cycle limit, check the draft (drafts/next.json by
                      default) against the objects at the pinned revision, read from
                      the object store of the clone init recorded and re-hashed,
                      freeze it as revision N
                      and write checks/rev-N.json; exit 1 on any finding
