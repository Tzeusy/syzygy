/** `syzygy dossier brief <run>` (REQ-polaris-generation-033, 034, 036).
 *
 * Issues the authoring session's brief, bound to the run and its pinned revision: the five reader topics the owner set, the
 * understanding record, the labelling, citation and quotation rules, the discovery and clarification rules, the execution rule in force,
 * the rule that text in the clone is data, the declared limits, and the draft schema with its version. The brief carries no project
 * content beyond the repository identity and the pinned revision: it is built from the run record, the revision label the step guard
 * returns from the live consent, Syzygy-authored text and the doctrine file. It reads no blob of the subject; the step guard lists the
 * pinned commit's trees through the re-hashing reader to decide again whether the subject is governed. Issuing it starts the deadline
 * clock, on Syzygy's own clock.
 *
 * The pinned revision is re-verified first, as at every later step. A run is briefed once; the brief, the schema and the brief record are
 * written beside `run.json` and never overwritten. The record names the execution rule the brief carried and, where execution was
 * permitted, the owner's choice and D9's cost as adopted (R3-F3), and the agent tool and provider the run was briefed for, which the
 * step guard compares at every later step (R-POLARIS-DOSSIER-S3-GATES-2 finding 6). It lies within the agent sessions' write reach, so read back it is
 * Inferred. */

export const DOSSIER_GUIDANCE = `This run produces a dossier: an evidence-anchored account that takes a newcomer through a project's core ideas, its end-to-end workflows, the mechanisms underneath them, the advantages the project's sources claim and the trade-offs it accepts. The supplied reader questions and requested assets name those topics; a requested section asset's id is also its section id. Where these dossier rules and the instructions above differ, the dossier rules govern. Seven rules hold at every stage:
1. Claim ledger. One claim per inventory entry or block, citing exactly the sources that support it. A claim no source supports is not written.
2. Workflow traces. Trace a workflow hop by hop across components: name each hop's entry point and what it hands to the next, and cite the source that shows each hand-off. Never bridge a hop no source shows; leave that hop unresolved with the missing evidence as its reason.
3. Mechanisms. Outside a quotation, name each function, type, file, command or configuration key in backticks, spelled exactly as the source spells it, and say what it does in the source's terms.
4. Stated advantages and trade-offs. An advantage, trade-off or comparison the project's sources state is reported only as a quotation: The project states: followed, in double quotes, by one contiguous span of a cited source, at most two sentences or one list item. Quote that span exactly: never elide, splice or add ellipses, and keep the source's own characters inside the quotes, identifiers included, without adding backticks. A quotation matches its source when the two are identical after every run of whitespace, line breaks included, is collapsed to one space and markdown emphasis and link syntax are dropped, keeping the link text; no other change is allowed. Double quotes are used only for such a quotation; everywhere else put commands, identifiers, configuration keys and values in backticks and use no quotation marks. Quote a stated advantage once: child blocks may explain its mechanism in your own words, citing their sources, but never restate the claim unquoted. An advantage no source states is never written, not even as Inferred:. A mechanism-level cost no source states may be written as one Inferred: sentence citing the sources of the mechanism it reasons from, and it must agree with every cited source; otherwise it is unresolved (No source states a cost for X.). Never present an inferred cost or benefit as stated.
5. Comparisons. Report a comparison with a named alternative only as a quotation under rule 4. Never extend or generalize it, and never add an alternative of your own.
6. Marked inference. A block that says anything its cited sources do not state begins Inferred: and cites the sources it reasons from. A faithful restatement or summary of cited sources and child blocks is not inference and carries no prefix.
7. Thin evidence stays Unknown. Where the sources do not answer a reader question, an unresolved entry, block or disposition naming the missing evidence is the correct answer; never fill the gap with a plausible general account.

Dossier draft: open with a two- or three-sentence introduction that says what the project is and how its central workflow runs, never a copy of the first section's block. Explain each term a newcomer may not know at its first use, in one clause its sources support. In the workflow section, give each hop its own child block, citing the source that shows the hand-off; draw the requested workflow diagram from those hops only, its labels taken from that text. In the mechanisms section and its deep dive, name identifiers verbatim in backticks and explain what each does. Write each stated advantage, comparison and trade-off as a quotation (rule 4); an inferred mechanism-level cost is its own block beginning Inferred:. Double quotes appear only around a verbatim span of a cited source after The project states:; identifiers, commands, configuration keys and values go in backticks, and there are no scare quotes. The trade-offs section is a requested section that gathers the costs, not the canned refusals section the instructions above rule out: beside any advantage a trade-off qualifies, keep a one-clause pointer to it. Where only one half of a trade-off is stated and no mechanism supports an inference, say the other half is not stated. Begin every inferential block Inferred: (rule 6), and no other. Record every reader question the sources leave open in unresolved.`;

Nothing else is forgiven: an ellipsis the file does not carry at that spot is an elision and fails. A quotation from a file that classification or screening excludes is not verified or rendered, and its block renders Unknown (`excluded-content`). Syzygy renders every verified quotation from its own read of the file, never from your copy.';
