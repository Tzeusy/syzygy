/** The session pair's provider statement, cited when a session is handed over and re-checked whenever its work is counted
 * (REQ-polaris-generation-033: "its withdrawal SHALL refuse further steps of any run that relies on it"; R-PR406-SESSION-TOOL-STATEMENT-1
 * E2, syzygy-q2o8).
 *
 * `session-prompt` admits a session's pair, its agent tool with the run's declared provider, only under exactly one in-force statement
 * (`session-handover.ts`), and records that statement in the prompt record's `context.providerStatement`: null for a run that relies on
 * no statement. When an inventory or a review verdict is counted (`inventoryOfRecord`, `reviewOfRecord`, `designReviewOfRecord`), the
 * gate runs again for the session's tool and the run's provider at that instant; the work counts only while the statement the prompt
 * record cites is still the single statement that governs the pair, and still lists every class the run's statement lists. The run
 * record decides whether the run relies on a statement at all (`subject.providerStatement`), as the step guard's own record does.
 *
 * Compatibility: a prompt record written before citations carries no `providerStatement` key. Its work counts only when the re-check
 * admits a statement now, and that statement is returned with `cited: null`, the citation at hand-over being Unknown. A record that cites
 * no statement (`null`) for a run that relies on one is refused. Every record read here lies within the agent sessions' write reach, so
 * the citation is Inferred. */
