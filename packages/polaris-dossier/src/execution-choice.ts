 * the observed project in the clone from that run's authoring session. It is taken only from this command, which the operator runs
 * personally; never from the run configuration, an earlier run, or a standing or per-project record. It is refused for another run or
 * revision, after the brief, while D9 is not established in force, when the configuration does not declare the operator to be the owner,
 * and without the operator's three declarations (R3-F2): that the owner started the authoring session, on the owner's own host, and
 * attends it. Syzygy cannot see who typed the command or whether the owner attends, so the record says both are the operator's
 * declaration, labelled Inferred. The record lies in the run directory, within the agent sessions' write reach.
 *
 * R3-F7: the record is not an execution consent (RFC5-12, `SOURCE-POLICY.md`) and approves no execution profile. Its format names it a
 * per-run execution choice, it lives only in the run directory, and nothing reads it as a consent. */
