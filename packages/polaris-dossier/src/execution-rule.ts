 * owner; the owner's execution choice for this run and this pinned revision, taken from `allow-execution` and recorded before the brief,
 * with the operator's declarations that the owner started the authoring session on the owner's own host and attends it; and the
 * adapter-credential probe passing. Only the authoring session's brief may carry the permission; any other role gets SEC-3's rule.
 *
 * The permitting arm is built here and kept off: `allow-execution` and the probe are S4's (syzygy-qkea.5), so until S4 lands no caller
 * passes ports and the arm stays disabled, and every brief carries SEC-3's rule with that reason stated. Tests enable it with fixture
 * ports. Syzygy cannot see who typed the choice or whether the owner attends, so both are the operator's declaration, labelled Inferred. */
