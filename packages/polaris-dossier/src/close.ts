/** `syzygy dossier close <run> [--usage-tokens N] [--usage-turns N]` (REQ-polaris-generation-033, 018; design "Command surface",
 * `close`; syzygy-qkea.11).
 *
 * In this order: a declared usage figure must be a positive integer (there is no zero usage: an undeclared figure is not recorded, never
 * 0); the pinned revision is verified again, the brief issued and the deadline not passed; a run is closed once; the adapter-credential
 * check runs where the brief permitted execution, and a breach is a finding of this step, recorded in the Execution Record. Then Syzygy
 * writes the run's Execution Record, `record.json`, once.
 *
 * The agent sessions' tokens and turns are invisible to Syzygy, so the record carries only the figure the operator declares, labelled
 * Inferred and attributed to the operator, and never as Observed or as a provider receipt; with none declared it says the usage was not
 * recorded and that Syzygy cannot observe it. Everything else the record carries from the run directory (the configuration, the brief's
 * execution rule, the agent's reported commands, the step instants, the breach log) is a stored record within the agent sessions' write
 * reach, and Inferred. The record copies no file body: no brief, prompt or transcript body enters it, only each stored file's digest.
 * Syzygy made no provider call for the run, issued no credential for it and wrote none to the state directory. */
