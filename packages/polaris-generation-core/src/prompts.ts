Return only structured JSON conforming to the trusted response schema supplied for this call, within its declared limits. Do not invent fields or identity kinds. Use provider-local handles for new content and only supplied handles for existing references; the trusted system issues persistent identities. Do not invent source references, permissions, evidence states or approvals.
Preserve material qualifications, contradictions, trade-offs and declared versus observed versus proposed meaning. Missing evidence stays explicitly unresolved with a reason; an Inferred label cannot excuse an unsupported claim. Generated content is editorial draft, not adopted intent. Follow the supplied schema's unresolved/failure representation when support or capability is missing; never silently truncate required material or downgrade requiredness.`;

  inventory: `Prepare the source inventory independently, using admitted sources and governing reader questions only. Do not draft or plan the manifesto, and do not use a candidate draft, outline, author's assessment or authoring conversation as your denominator.
Account for the complete admitted-source population, including sources that appear irrelevant. Identify the supported purpose, beneficiary, thesis, motives, capabilities, choices, unfamiliar terms and limits, with exact supplied support references. Retain qualifications, conflicts and unresolved questions. Give every material source claim an explicit relevance or justified omission disposition; do not hide inconvenient evidence. This inventory is review evidence, not new project intent.`,
  plan: `Using the frozen inventory and admitted sources, plan an argument a newcomer can follow: why this particular project exists, its central idea, the capabilities that serve it and the choices that shape them. Choose section order from this project's evidence, not a fixed template or another project's architecture.
For each section identify its reader question, the answer it opens with and its supported claims. Propose a diagram only where a flow, lifecycle, state machine, boundary, dependency or placement is clearer drawn than written; name its kind, the relationship it explains, supported elements, edge meanings, qualifications and text equivalents. Identify the first helpful visual and place it near the idea it explains. Do not invent a linear sequence or relationships for a tidy layout.
Plan optional question-led mini deep dives linked from the relevant prose or diagram, with a clear return to the parent. Use contents, glossary and comparison tables only when they help. Account for every requested asset with the schema's disposition and a reason; unsupported required assets remain unresolved. Computed visuals are unsupported in this version; curated diagrams cannot satisfy a required computed visual.`,
  author: `Write a coherent, concise manifesto following the supported argument. Open with the purpose and thesis, then develop capabilities and design choices as an abstraction tree that keeps the argument connected. Each section opens with its answer in its first block, in one sentence; child blocks add the mechanisms and evidence beneath the parent they explain. Each parent must truly summarize its children, so truncating at any depth leaves a true account; never state a conclusion only at depth. Give each block one point, use concrete verbs and meaningful headings, explain jargon at first use and avoid repeated summaries, source-path catalogs and walls of text. Preserve the creator's supported vocabulary without inventing beliefs, quotations or first-person testimony.
Keep limits and tensions beside the promises they qualify; do not create a canned refusals section. Distinguish exact source text from synthesis. Split ambiguous claim-bearing blocks so every claim's support is recoverable.
Produce structured narrative and useful assets. Draw a diagram where a flow, lifecycle, state machine, boundary, dependency or placement is clearer drawn than written, naming its kind and the relationship it explains. Every node and edge label must also appear in the section's text. Every diagram edge needs support as well as its endpoints; preserve direction, multiplicity and meaning, including supported cycles. Never draw an unsupported element; disclose it as unresolved instead. Mark each node and edge observed, inferred or unknown; unknown only where support establishes the element but its state is unknown. Include qualifications and equivalent text. Place diagrams near their explanation. Mini deep dives should answer a natural follow-up question with supported relationships and trade-offs, linked to parent and evidence; a raw source disclosure is not a deep dive. Keep all internal destinations real and every requested asset disposition explicit.`,
  edit: `Read the candidate as one argument. Improve rhythm, transitions, specificity and section order; remove repetitive summaries and document-management language. Replace dense catalogs with concise connected explanation where that preserves meaning. Explain unfamiliar terms, keep qualifications beside their claims and never smooth conflicts into consensus.
Preserve the abstraction tree: each section opens with its answer, each parent summarizes its children and truncating at any depth stays true. Improve useful diagram placement and mini-deep-dive discoverability without changing supported relationship meaning; keep every diagram label in its section's text and every drawn element's support and marking. Preserve source support and report changed content and affected references using the supplied schema. Do not invent evidence, omit material qualifications for elegance or claim the revision is independently reviewed. A changed draft requires fresh applicable review.`,
  fidelity: `Independently review the exact candidate against the owning admitted sources, frozen inventory and supplied acceptance criteria. First check the inventory's accuracy and completeness against the complete admitted-source population. A flawed inventory must produce findings; it cannot certify a draft merely because that draft matches it.
Check coverage in both directions: every material source/inventory entry must be represented or have a justified omission, and every generated claim-bearing block, table cell, glossary explanation, deep dive and factual diagram element/edge must have actual support. Resolving an anchor is not proof it supports the attached claim. Identify unused or misplaced anchors, lost qualifications, hidden conflicts, wrong states/provenance, unsupported claims and misleading edge meaning.
Check every requested asset disposition and every reading depth against its own questions; deep source access cannot repair an inadequate introduction. Return findings tied to supplied handles, severity and unresolved reasons using the trusted schema. Do not rewrite the draft, accept the author's self-assessment as evidence, or grant owner approval. This source review cannot certify rendered layout, keyboard navigation or interaction that you have not observed.`,
  repair: `Repair only the supplied named findings within the remaining declared budget and the same evidence, capability and output bounds. Return the schema's affected content and finding-to-change dispositions; retain explicit unresolved findings when a valid repair is unsupported. Preserve unrelated supported claims, material qualifications, relationship semantics and required assets. Preserve tree structure and diagram support: each section's answer stays first, parents summarize their children, every diagram label stays in its section's text and every drawn element stays supported and marked; never draw an unsupported element.
Identify changed dependencies requiring renewed validation. Do not overwrite prior review records, mark your own repairs accepted or reuse a stale verdict for changed bytes. Stop when the allowed attempts end; exhaustion is not success.`,

const dossierRules = `This run produces a dossier: an evidence-anchored account that takes a newcomer through a project's core ideas, its end-to-end workflows, the mechanisms underneath them, the advantages the project's sources claim and the trade-offs it accepts. The supplied reader questions and requested assets name those topics; a requested section asset's id is also its section id. Where these dossier rules and the instructions above differ, the dossier rules govern. Seven rules hold at every stage:
1. Claim ledger. One claim per inventory entry or block, citing exactly the sources that support it. A claim no source supports is not written.
2. Workflow traces. Trace a workflow hop by hop across components: name each hop's entry point and what it hands to the next, and cite the source that shows each hand-off. Never bridge a hop no source shows; leave that hop unresolved with the missing evidence as its reason.
3. Mechanisms. Name each function, type, file, command or configuration key in backticks, spelled exactly as the source spells it, and say what it does in the source's terms.
4. Stated advantages and trade-offs. An advantage, trade-off or comparison the project's sources state is reported only as a quotation: The project states: followed by one or two sentences in double quotes, taken from a cited source. A quotation matches its source when the two are identical after every run of whitespace, line breaks included, is collapsed to one space and markdown emphasis and link syntax are dropped, keeping the link text; no other change is allowed. A mechanism-level cost no source states may be written as one Inferred: sentence citing the sources of the mechanism it reasons from; otherwise it is unresolved (No source states a cost for X.). Never present an inferred cost or benefit as stated.
5. Comparisons. Report a comparison with a named alternative only as a quotation under rule 4. Never extend or generalize it, and never add an alternative of your own.
6. Marked inference. A block that says anything its cited sources do not state begins Inferred: and cites the sources it reasons from. A faithful restatement or summary of cited sources and child blocks is not inference and carries no prefix.
7. Thin evidence stays Unknown. Where the sources do not answer a reader question, an unresolved entry, block or disposition naming the missing evidence is the correct answer; never fill the gap with a plausible general account.`;

A cost or benefit that is neither stated nor inferable from a cited mechanism, and any reader question the sources do not answer, is an entry citing the source nearest the question, with an unresolved disposition whose reason names the missing evidence.`,
  plan: `Dossier plan: plan one section per requested section asset, with that asset's id, in an order that lets each section build on the last. Say in each section's reason which reader question it answers and which inventory entries carry it. In the workflow section's reason, name the hops a flow diagram would draw and their sources; in the mechanisms section's reason, name the follow-up question a mechanism deep dive answers. A required section the inventory cannot support keeps an unresolved disposition naming the missing evidence.`,
  author: `Dossier draft: in the workflow section, give each hop its own child block, citing the source that shows the hand-off; draw the requested workflow diagram from those hops only, its labels taken from that text. In the mechanisms section and its deep dive, name identifiers verbatim in backticks and explain what each does. Write each stated advantage, comparison and trade-off as a quotation (rule 4); an inferred mechanism-level cost is its own block beginning Inferred:. Where only one half of a trade-off is stated and no mechanism supports an inference, say the other half is not stated. Begin every inferential block Inferred: (rule 6), and no other. Record every reader question the sources leave open in unresolved.`,
  edit: `Dossier edit: never turn a quotation into the dossier's own voice or change it beyond rule 4's normalization, drop an Inferred: prefix or add one to a faithful restatement, drop or respell a backticked identifier, merge two workflow hops into one block, or replace an unresolved gap with prose.`,
  fidelity: `Dossier review: also check that every quotation matches a cited source under rule 4's normalization; that no comparison is extended beyond its quotation; that each backticked identifier appears verbatim in a cited source; that each workflow hop's cited source shows that hand-off; that no trade-off half is presented as stated unless a cited source states it, and that an Inferred: half cites the sources it reasons from; and that every block saying more than its cited sources state begins Inferred:, while a faithful restatement carries no prefix. Each failure is a finding on the block concerned.`,
