/**
 * Rendered-design review record and its trusted verdict (REQ-polaris-generation-004
 * "Relationship that needs a diagram has none" / "Partly supported diagram";
 * REQ-polaris-generation-006 readiness and retired evidence).
 *
 * Phase A mechanics only. The generation pipeline still never awards rendered
 * readiness; this is the verdict a later rendered-review stage consumes. Nothing
 * here dispatches a reviewer, renders a page or judges clarity: the independent
 * reviewer's enumeration and judgments are the input, and this module computes
 * which of them block from that enumeration alone, never from reviewer-set flags.
 *
 * The link between a relationship and a figure is the review's own `diagram`
 * arm: the reviewer names the one draft diagram it judged to draw that
 * relationship. A relationship is satisfied only through that name, and a
 * diagram named by two diagram-clearer relationships satisfies neither, so the
 * number of other figures in the draft never matters (unrelated extra figures
 * cannot stand in). A `prose-sufficient` relationship naming a diagram the
 * draft does not contain is a malformed record and throws; a `diagram-clearer`
 * one blocks instead (`missing-diagram` when supported or partly supported,
 * `undrawable-without-recorded-omission` when unsupported).
 *
 * One name per relationship: an undrawable relationship drawn in any produced
 * figure must name that figure, which blocks. Naming a figure that records its
 * omission while another figure draws it misstates the record; the verdict
 * cannot detect that misstatement, since it sees only the name given.
 *
 * The judgment decides only whether a diagram is required. Whatever the
 * judgment, a named produced figure may never draw an unsupported relationship,
 * and one drawing a partly supported relationship must record its gap.
 * `diagram-clearer` with `unsupported` support is the spec's undrawable
 * relationship: its recorded omission is the named draft diagram carrying the
 * `omitted` disposition. Two further conditions are outside this verdict: that
 * the gap is disclosed in the rendered account at the depth it affects, and
 * whether a requested asset requires the visual anyway (`validateStage` owns
 * requested-asset dispositions).
 *
 * What the verdict trusts rather than checks. A relationship's `sourceIds` are
 * shape-checked only (non-empty handles) and never resolved against the
 * draft's premises; `support` is the reviewer's judgment, and the verdict
 * derives blocking from it without re-deriving it. The spec's "Partly
 * supported diagram" condition that supported nodes drawn with none of the
 * relationship's edges are not a produced diagram is likewise not checked
 * here: it is trusted to the figure's `produced` disposition.
