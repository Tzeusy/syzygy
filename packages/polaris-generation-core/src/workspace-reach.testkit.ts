// more than one target (syzygy-bpyt.8.36, the review of 8.34, N1); and a bare name some manifest declares as a local dependency,
// which npm installs under that name from a directory or another package's name (syzygy-bpyt.8.37, the review of 8.36, N2). A `#`
// alias it names is followed to its target.

 *   as a directory or a file, except in the root's manifest under a workspace's own name, where npm links that workspace;
 * - `link:` and `workspace:`: npm does not install them at all (npm-package-arg 12.0.2 throws EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL), except in
 *   the root's manifest under a workspace's own name, as above, and another package manager might link them (not observed here);
 * - `npm:`: an alias. npm-package-arg 12.0.2 accepts only a registry spec after `npm:`. npm 11.5.1 skips each declaration in the
 *   root's manifest under a workspace's own name, whatever its version, and links that workspace. For every other declaration, npm
 *   fetches the alias's spec from the registry unless that declaration is under a workspace's own name and the alias's range is `*`,
 *   absent or one that workspace's version satisfies; then npm links the workspace, as for a plain range so declared. Every workspace
 *   here is `@syzygy/`-scoped, and the `@syzygy/*` branch reads such a name before this pattern. Its target may carry a workspace
 *   package's name, which another package manager might link locally (not observed here); every alias is refused, failing closed.
 * The tarball arm also matches a tarball URL (`https://…/x.tgz`), which npm types as `remote`, and a git spec whose text ends in a
 * tarball extension (`github:someone/dossier#v1.tar`), which npm types as `git`; both are refused too, failing closed.
 * Residual (syzygy-bpyt.8.38): npm also reads a directory spec with no leading `./`, `../`, `/` or `~/` (`packages/polaris-dossier/`,
 * `.hidden-lib`, `a/b/c`) as a directory. Those still read as outside the workspace; widening the pattern to them changes what the
 * guards refuse and needs a GP-Q0 ruling first.
 * Residual (the review of 8.39, N2): a workspace whose name is not `@syzygy/`-scoped is read by its bare name as outside the
 * workspace (unless some manifest declares that name with a version this pattern matches), while npm links it under that name
 * and Node loads it from there. At syzygy-bpyt.8.39, 0 of the 12 workspaces are unscoped; closing it changes what the guards
 * refuse and needs a GP-Q0 ruling first. */
