// RFC5-3: classification by credential presented, never network
// location; RFC5-5/RFC5-6: the daemon's real credential store, arriving
// exactly where core admission.ts said it would).
//
// Posture:
// - Issuance and verification are LOCAL. No external identity provider,
//   no network call, no clock read: the token is random bytes minted
//   once and persisted under the daemon state directory.
// - Fail-closed polarity, inherited from core `admitClient`: every arm
//   that is not affirmatively admitted is core's own named refusal
//   `{ admitted: false, served: 'nothing' }` — never a bare error
//   string, never a partial admission. This module NARROWS core
//   admission (the token must equal the minted token), it never widens
//   it: a credential core would refuse is refused here by core itself,
//   before any comparison runs.
// - Every filesystem write is routed through `authorizeStateWrite` —
//   the state-plane analogue of write-guard's governed-plane boundary.
//   The state directory is the daemon's ONE authorized write home;
//   nothing here can write anywhere else.

// The fixed credential location inside the state directory. Fixed here
// once; nothing configures it (same discipline as the declaration
// path in observation.ts).
