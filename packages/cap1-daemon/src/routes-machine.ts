// RT4 — the authenticated JSON machine endpoint (CAP1-REQ-040..046,
// 060, 062..064 at the transport). This module is TRANSPORT ONLY: every
// fact in the response body is an unchanged core output over the shared
// evaluation — `serveMachine` for the fact set (RFC6-13: one truth, two
// consumers), `renderState`/`renderProposal` for the proposed-vs-current
// plane, `extract*Distinctions`/`sweepDistinctions` for CAP1-REQ-064's
// machine-readable distinctions, and the stable-identity enumerations
// for CAP1-REQ-060. Nothing here mints, renames, or drops a fact; no
// clock is read, no randomness is drawn, no file is touched.
//
// The evaluation source is INJECTED (`getEvaluation`) and is the same
// single source the human page serves from — the composition root wires
// both channels to one evaluation, so the two channels expose the same
// facts by construction (CAP1-REQ-041), judged only by the independent
// parity oracle in the tests, never by this module's claim.
//
// Honesty on the non-evaluated arms (VIS-2): a declaration that failed
// to validate or was never observed is served as its NAMED arm with its
// verbatim reasons — never a 500, never an empty or favourable 200.

// The one machine route this wave mounts. Exact pathname; the daemon's
// route registry matches it byte-for-byte.

//   proposal with its proposed marking and no status authority
//   (CAP1-REQ-063: no code path merges a proposal into `current`).

//   stamp itself travels on `state.current.evaluation` (CAP1-REQ-042/
//   060; RFC6-15: an answer that cannot name its evaluation is not an
//   answer).
// - `identities`: the stable identity-field enumerations, verbatim from
//   core (CAP1-REQ-060's sweep denominator).
// - `distinctions`: CAP1-REQ-064's machine-readable attributes — per
//   fact, per repository consent state, per proposal — plus core's
//   sweep, which HONESTLY lists uncovered distinction kinds as missing
