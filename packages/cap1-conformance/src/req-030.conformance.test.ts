// SDR-36, each carrying its own value and fact set; count and name
// comparison, bounded at seven. Oracle independence: the expected names
// are hard-coded below from the recorded owner ruling (SDR-36) as the
// spec authors them — never imported from the implementation.
// Falsifier: a missing or extra answer, an answer whose value is a
// function of another answer's value, or a renamed answer.

// The seven names, verbatim from SDR-36 as authored at CAP1-REQ-030 —
// hard-coded, in the requirement's own order.
