// CAP1-REQ-035 — Several reasons may be visible at once; one never
// hides the others (event-response).
//
// Case: a checker constructs a claim with two applicable conditions
// (here: one unconsented repository and one unreachable repository both
// constituent to the `Observable` answer — an instance of the
// requirement's "e.g."). Observable: the served reason set on the claim
// instance. Oracle: the served instance carries one primary and the
// applicable secondaries, each verbatim; set comparison against the
// fixture's known conditions; bounded — one claim, one set. Oracle
// independence: the fixture defines which conditions hold; the
// vocabulary defines the spellings — hard-coded below from RFC2-24,
// never imported. Falsifier: a claim with two known conditions served
// with one reason and no secondary, or a secondary spelling outside the
// twelve.
