// CAP1-REQ-014 — Incomplete coverage is never rendered as complete
// coverage.
//
// Case: a fixture where one of two consented repositories could not be
// fully captured. Oracle: the partial capture carries an explicit
// captured-scope declaration, the uncaptured portion renders Unknown,
// and no full-scope claim renders as whole (RFC2-23 "Partial snapshot").
// Oracle independence: the fixture defines which source is partial; the
// disclosure obligation comes from RFC2-23, not from the implementation.
//
// The "enumerated aggregate set" of the pure layer is small by design:
// the full-scope claims this layer can serve are `isComplete` and the
// boundary's declared scopes — both swept below. Human-view aggregates
// arrive with later slices and take their own sweeps then.
