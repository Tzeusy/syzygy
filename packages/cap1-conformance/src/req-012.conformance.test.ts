// CAP1-REQ-012 — Unconsented renders Unknown as a policy state, never as
// error or absence.
//
// Case: the checker declares a repository, withholds its consent record,
// and queries. Oracle: the served value for the unconsented portion is
// `Unknown` with the exact reason string
// `unconsented-source-or-provider`; string comparison decides. Oracle
// independence: the expected string below is written literally from
// RFC2-24's closed vocabulary (reason #6), outside the implementation —
// it is deliberately NOT imported from the implementation's vocabulary
// module.
