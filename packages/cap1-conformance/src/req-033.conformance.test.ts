// CAP1-REQ-033 — Every answer exposes its constituent facts and scope
// (state projection/query).
//
// Case: a checker selects one shape answer and requests its facts.
// Observable: the fact set — constituent facts, declared scope,
// producing evaluation. Oracle: the served fact set is non-empty, names
// the scope, every fact resolves (is served in full), and the served
// value's stated basis references only facts present in the set;
// per-answer check, bounded at seven answers. Oracle independence:
// resolvability is checked by following the served facts, not by
// trusting the answer. Falsifier: an answer served with no reachable
// constituent facts, or facts that do not support the served value's
// stated basis.
