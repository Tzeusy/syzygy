// CAP1-REQ-032 — Registration is never certification (invariant).
//
// Case (scope of quantification): all pairs of shape answers;
// counterexample schema: an answer whose served value changes when a
// fact OUTSIDE its own declared constituent-fact set (CAP1-REQ-030) is
// flipped. Sweep: flip one underlying fact at a time and record all
// seven served values per flip — denominator: the flip set × seven
// observations, with every flip's declared-set membership enumerated
// first. Oracle: each flip changes only the answers whose declared
// constituent-fact sets contain the flipped fact; a shared fact (the
// declaration is constituent to Registered, Shape present, and
// Observable) moving its dependents together is conformance, not
// coupling; a value moving with NO declared-set membership in the
// flipped fact is the violation. Oracle independence: the fixture
// controls the underlying facts; declared-set membership comes from
// CAP1-REQ-030's definitions (enumerated below), not from the
// implementation; the oracle observes served values only. Falsifier:
// registering a project raising any other answer above `Unknown`
// absent its own evidence, or any answer's value moving with a fact its
// declared constituent set does not contain.
