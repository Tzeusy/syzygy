// N8 slice 1 (syzygy-u05.8) — measure how general the unmodified PWB
// extraction pipeline is, over synthetic corpora in container shapes
// Butlers does not use. This module runs `extractClass` (the literal
// grammar, unchanged) against each fixture in `fixtures/synthetic-corpora.js`
// for every one of the nine extraction classes, and reports each cell's
// outcome honestly: `extracted` with its item count, or `unknown` with the
// pipeline's own failure reason. A cell is never coerced to pass, and an
// unextracted cell is never reported as zero — it carries no count at all,
// only the reason.
//
// `repairKind` records what closing a gap would need, not whether it is
// authorized:
//   - 'profile-row': the class's own extractor never ran the corpus's
//     grammar at all, because `project-shape-extraction.ts` gates that
//     class on one literal basename or path pattern
//     (`posixBasename(path) !== 'vision.md'`, and similarly for the other
//     eight). A container-shape profile row could in principle admit the
//     path without a code change; the class's own grammar would still need
//     to recognize what is actually there. N8 slice 2 (syzygy-u05.8)
//     investigated building that row: `principle`'s admission basename and
//     grammar (`vision.md`, top-level decimal list) are the literal PWB-
//     REQ-002 "Reader definitions" text in
//     `openspec/changes/polaris-project-wide-butlers-model/specs/
//     polaris-project-wide-butlers-model/spec.md`, and the same basenames
//     are proven byte-equal to the act-bound registry/policy JSON
//     (`project-shape-manifest.test.ts`). Admitting a new container shape
//     is therefore a governed-plane change (a spec amendment plus a
//     registry/policy amendment act), not an implementation-plane one, and
//     stays undone here; this module still only reports the gap honestly.
//   - 'code-path': the corpus's own target class *is* admitted by the
//     basename gate, and its own grammar failure is a genuine shape
//     mismatch (`malformed-list` or `malformed-row`: a bullet list where it
//     expects a decimal list, a table where it expects a list, prose where
//     it expects a table). Only new parsing logic closes this gap; no
//     profile row can. Narrowed in N8 slice 2 to these two reasons only: a
//     target-class failure for any other reason (a missing or duplicated
//     heading, an ambiguous leading label, a malformed TOML table) is a
//     defect in the fixture's own authoring, not a generality finding about
//     the pipeline, and must not be labeled as one.
// Every other failing cell (a class whose basename happens to match a
// corpus it was not authored for, so it fails on missing content rather
// than a shape or basename question) carries its raw reason with no
// repair classification — it is not a generality finding.
