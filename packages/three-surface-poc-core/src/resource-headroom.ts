// The resource ledger on the surfaces (pursuit N3 slice 3, syzygy-u05.3).
// One machine block, `PocModel.resourceHeadroom`, carries the ledger's
// headroom against all seven declared limits and its cost record, each a
// tuple with its own id so the human status entry is compared with it per
// tuple, by id. Purely derived from `ResourceLedgerSummary` (VIS-6): no new
// observation and no new limit. When no ledger ran (the project shape was
// not observed) every observed and remaining value and the cost record are
// Unknown with the reason, never zero (VIS-2); the declared limits are the
// registry's and stay known. The block carries no capture instant, so the
// response identity's content key covers it and no exclusion is added.
