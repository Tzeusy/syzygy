// foreclosed it.

// Order is load-bearing. A foreclosed effect is refused before the
// registry entry is consulted, because a foreclosure is lifted only by
// new owner acts, never by registry text alone (P-71-Q5: a future run
// needs a dated act naming the write, then a registry-entry amendment,
// then a fresh implementation authorization). Any other effect is
// authorized only when the registry entry's `writeSurface` names it.
