"""Check the response-ceiling reading packet (syzygy-dov.27, P-77 Q2).

The packet is a plain owner-direction offering: it binds no digest, so
there is no manifest to build. What can drift is what it quotes and what it
covers. This script checks, read-only:

  C1 every quoted clause is present, whitespace-normalized, both in its
     source file and in the packet;
  C2 the packet names every response ceiling whose registry sentence opens
     "the final encoded HTTP body", in the registry as it stands and as the
     candidate .18 patch would leave it;
  C3 no non-test TypeScript or JavaScript source under apps/*/src or
     packages/*/src carries compression code outside what an issued,
     unwithdrawn direction permits (a sweep over zero files fails). The
     direction permits a coding only through fixed markers: paragraph 1
     ("THE READING.") carries a Q1 (a) or (b) answer, and paragraph 2
     ("WHAT MAY SHIP.") opens with a clause in PERMIT_MARKERS. Today the
     one marker is the issued Q5 (a) clause, which permits gzip: the terms
     zlib, gzip and content-encoding leave the sweep and every other term
     stays in it. A decisions file anywhere under decisions/ closes the
     gate when one of its paragraphs names the direction (file name or
     Decision ID) beside a form of "withdraw" or "narrow".
  C4 the packet keeps its candidate banner, an open-questions section in
     which every question states a default, and no 64-hex digest;
  C5 every candidate patch under contracts/candidates/*/proposed/ that
     targets a quoted file leaves every quote from that file intact, both
     applied alone and composed in sequence with the others (sorted by
     path; a patch that does not apply on top of the earlier ones is
     reported, not failed).

--selftest breaks each predicate in a scratch fixture and confirms failure.

Known limits of C3 (R-DOV27-2 N2/N3, bd syzygy-dov.31), none fail-open on
the issued direction's own text:
  - the sweep is a line-level term match, not a parse: compression reached
    through an alias, a computed import specifier, a dependency other than
    the `compression` package, or a coding name split across lines is not
    seen;
  - a withdrawal or narrowing whose naming words and withdrawing words sit
    in different paragraphs (a blank line or a new list item apart) does
    not close the gate, and one that names
    neither the file nor the Decision ID is not seen at all;
  - any withdrawal or narrowing word closes the gate, whatever it narrows
    (fail-closed);
  - a direction permitting a coding other than gzip opens nothing until
    PERMIT_MARKERS names its clause (fail-closed);
  - the sweep reads apps/*/src and packages/*/src only, minus node_modules,
    dist and test-fixtures, and skips *.test.* files.
