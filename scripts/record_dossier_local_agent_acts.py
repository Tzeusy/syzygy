"""Record or verify the owner's acts of the local-agent dossier sitting.

Package `contracts/candidates/dossier-local-agent-acts/`. Each act is a
separate state-(1) owner act over one record named by a row of
`DOSSIER-LOCAL-AGENT-SITTING-MANIFEST.txt`:

- the project-input statement that no kernel evidence drawer exists for
  `(project:syzygy, repository:redis-redis)` (REQ-polaris-generation-033's
  non-governed route);
- two per-project agent-provider statements for the same repository, Claude
  Code with Anthropic and Codex with OpenAI (its governed route, and SEC-2's
  per-project consent);
- the in-force record of D9 over the exact bytes of `security.md` and `v1.md`;
- the in-force record of item 1 of the owner direction
  `POLARIS-DOSSIER-LOCAL-AGENT-RULINGS-2026-10-05` (the RFC7-20 reading) over
  that direction file's exact bytes.

The last two give the review note R3-F8's act cross-check (RFC3-16(a)) an
exact-digest, scope-bound act to find. A phrase act over adopted doctrine or a
plain direction is new usage: the doctrine and the direction keep their own
adoption, and these acts change no byte of either.

The owner gives each act by selecting an option in a structured question that
names the record "at the manifest row" (the public-admission precedent). No
phrase is typed and no digest appears in the packet. This script performs
nothing by itself, and it refuses to record anything until the package has a
confirming review: `FROZEN_SUBJECT` is unset until a round returns `CONFIRM`
or a notes-only `CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`, and the frozen digests below are
then filled in by script, never by hand. The commit is provenance only.

`--record KEY ARGUMENT --date D [--instant I] --question-opening Q
--selection-label L --selection-description S` requires, before anything is
written:

1. the argument is a 64-hex SHA-256 equal to this record's manifest row, the
   manifest's `instances/` rows are exactly the builder's records, and the
   builder reports nothing stale (so a record whose bound doctrine or
   direction bytes changed is refused);
2. the record on disk hashes to the argument;
3. every file the review read hashes to the digest recorded below for it (the
   packet may gain one PERFORMED head), and the packet carries no 64-hex token;
4. the confirming raw's first four non-blank lines carry
   `Reviewed commit: <40 hex>`, `Manifest SHA-256: <SHA-256 of the manifest
   FILE, the value the builder's --manifest-digest prints, never a row>` and
   a verdict of `CONFIRM` or `CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`; the latter clears the
   bytes only when every finding is a `note` and the sibling
   `ROUND-<n>-DISPOSITIONS.md` names the raw and dispositions every finding;
5. the owner's selection (opening, label, description) is non-empty, one line
   each, and carries no 64-hex digest.

It then writes the dedicated record (with the UTC instant of recording) and
one `ACCEPTANCE-ACT-RECORD.md` section. `--check` re-derives both and counts
exactly one copy of the block. `--selftest` mutates each predicate and
requires it to fail closed.

## Ceremony

The owner was presented the confirmed packet at
`{PACKET_REL.as_posix()}`, which by design carries no digest. The act takes
this phrase, whose argument is this record's row of the sitting manifest:

```text
{phrase_for(act, argument)}
```

The owner did not type the phrase. On {date} the owner answered a structured
question in the Claude Code CLI that opened "{sel.opening}" by selecting the
option below; the selection is the instruction, and it names the record "at
the manifest row". The label and description, verbatim:

| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| "{sel.label}" | "{sel.description}" |

The argument was read from this record's row of
`{MANIFEST_REL.as_posix()}` at the frozen commit and matched the record on
disk at recording. A swapped argument would have been refused: the recorder
rejects an argument that is not this record's row.

Frozen provenance:

- frozen subject (package bytes): `{frozen}`;
- the sitting manifest file hashes to `{manifest_sha}` (a container digest,
  no act's argument; worded so CG-7e's bare-heading pass does not read it as
  a stale copy of this act's argument);
- confirmation review: `{CONFIRMATION_REVIEW_REL.as_posix()}`, verdict
  `{verdict}`, its head bound to the manifest file's SHA-256 above; notes, if
  any, are dispositioned in `{DISPOSITION_REL.as_posix()}`; the raw names
  reviewed commit `{reviewed}` [Observed — the raw's own line; binding is by
  digest]; and
- recording tag: `{tag_for(act, date)}`, on the commit carrying this act record.

## Effect

{act.effect}

## What this act does not authorize

This act satisfies only its own authority; the sitting's other acts each take
their own act and none implies another (REQ-polaris-generation-025). It gives
no observation consent, adopts no registry entry or screening policy, amends
no doctrine, contract or specification, and grants no read, egress, write,
execution, deployment, release, autonomous or multi-user authority beyond
what its Effect states. It proves no read, screening, generation or answer
result.
