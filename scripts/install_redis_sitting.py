"""Perform the install change that follows the Redis sitting's act records.

Candidate tooling. It performs no owner act and writes no act record; it makes
the repository's checks agree with acts the recorders have already written.
`scripts/simulate_redis_sitting.py` runs it in a scratch clone and requires the
end state to be green; the runbook (`docs/polaris-generation/REDIS-SITTING-RUNBOOK.md`)
lists each step with the finding it answers.

Run from the repository root after every recorder has run:

  python3 scripts/install_redis_sitting.py            # install
  python3 scripts/install_redis_sitting.py --check    # report what is not installed
  python3 scripts/install_redis_sitting.py --selftest
  python3 scripts/install_redis_sitting.py --only policy,reconcile   # a later policy act alone

It refuses (exit 2, nothing written) unless every required act record exists.
It is idempotent: a second run changes nothing and says so. Each step asserts
that the text it patches carries its anchor exactly once, so a drifted
`check_governance.py` fails loudly instead of being patched in the wrong place.

Steps (finding numbers are the runbook's):

  registrations   F5   performed admission and registry records become registered
                       act-copy files; their `manifest SHA-256:` heading is a
                       checked exemption
  rfc5            F6   the RFC-0005 patch applies to both mirrors; the active
                       manifest row and the directive register are regenerated;
                       the amendment becomes a row-argument contract chain link
  policy          F4,F10  the screening-scope act becomes the policy's chain link (the
                       2026-10-02 re-pin turns to history); when the version-2 act
                       exists it is the final link and version 1 turns to history
                       too, and likewise version 3 over version 2 (its manifest's
                       variant-tagged row pinned as history); the read gate, its tests and the status battery and
                       workflow follow the final act, once (an act pair recorded
                       in the wrong order is refused)
  profile         F8,F11  the narrative-profile spec moves from proposed/ to
                       specs/; package prose naming the old path is rewritten;
                       the status page figure follows the recount tool (both
                       figures, once the dossier addition is signed off) and
                       its lead-in names the profile and its adoption record;
                       the openspec/README.md row names the record
  reconcile       B3   `check_spec_reconciliation.py --regenerate`: the census
                       and each installed addition's generated union
