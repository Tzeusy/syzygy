"""Record/check the owner's adoption of the specification-policy readability restyle.

The owner performs it by writing exactly

    CONFIRM SPECIFICATION POLICY READABILITY RESTYLE: <sha256>

where the argument is the sha256 of the package manifest *file*
`candidates/spec-policy-readability-restyle/SPEC-POLICY-AMENDMENT-MANIFEST.txt`,
built and verified by `scripts/build_spec_policy_readability_restyle.py`.

One phrase confirms both policies. The recorder derives, from the manifest's
two rows, the nested craft-amendment lines every existing check reads:

    CONFIRM CRAFT AMENDMENT: CC-IMPACT@<row digest>
    CONFIRM CRAFT AMENDMENT: CC-SPEC@<row digest>

They are recorder-generated from the confirmed manifest, never presented as
words the owner typed.

The recorder is pinned to the reviewed package:

- `FROZEN_MANIFEST_SHA`: the manifest-file digest the confirming review
  examined and the owner is offered;
- `REVIEW` / `REVIEW_SHA`: that review's retained raw, by path and sha256.
  Its first four non-blank lines must carry `Verdict: CONFIRM` or
  `Verdict: CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS` and
  `Manifest SHA-256: <FROZEN_MANIFEST_SHA>` — the digest of the manifest
  *file*, which is the argument the owner speaks, not a row digest.

All three are pinned to the package and its confirming review.
`--record` refuses while any pin is `None`, when the owner's phrase is not
the exact `LABEL: <sha256>` form, when its argument differs from the current
manifest digest, when that digest differs from the pin, when the raw's sha or
head differ, or when the package does not verify unapplied. The order is
fixed: record first, then `build_spec_policy_readability_restyle.py --apply
--at-adoption` in the same change.

`--record --phrase "<owner phrase verbatim>"` writes three things:

- the dedicated record `decisions/SPEC-POLICY-READABILITY-RESTYLE-ADOPTION-ACT.md`;
- one marked section appended to `decisions/ACCEPTANCE-ACT-RECORD.md`, the
  dedicated record's bytes;
- one marked section appended to the craft `INSTALL-RECORD.md`.

Each record carries the owner's phrase once, and each nested line once.
`--check` verifies the pins, that every record regenerates exactly, and that
each marked section occurs once; it reports "not performed" and exits 0 when
no record exists, and fails on a partial record.

Owner: Tzeusy

Act instant: {instant}

Project identity: project:syzygy

Artifact identity: policy:syzygy:cc-spec-cc-impact:readability-restyle

Act type: confirm craft amendment (successor to acts 6 and 7 and to row 5 of the general trusted-bootstrap transaction)

Provenance: owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)

A1 audit-record identity: explicitly absent

The owner performed the act by writing exactly:

```text
{LABEL}: {sha}
```

The argument is the sha256 of {MANIFEST}. It was recomputed at recording,
matched the phrase, and equals the reviewed digest the recorder pins.

Confirming review: {pins.review} (sha256 {pins.review_sha})

The recorder derived one craft-amendment line per manifest row. They are not
words the owner typed; they name each policy's confirmed digest:

```text
{lines}
```

Scope: readability restyle of CC-SPEC-1…11 and CC-IMPACT-1…7, plus the
status-banner corrections disclosed in the package's decision packet. Clause
leads, headings and identifiers are unchanged by construction (the package
builder verifies all three). CC-IMPACT-7's fixture pin is unchanged.

Supersession relationship: each policy's current bytes are bound by its row
above. The act-6, act-7 and transaction-row digests remain preserved as
act-time history.

Revocation relationship: none. This act grants no implementation, source,
provider, write, deployment or release permission.

This is bootstrap owner provenance, not independent authorship verification,
runtime evidence or product readiness.
