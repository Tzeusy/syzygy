"""Record/check the owner's adoption of the contract readability restyle.

The act is the second link of `CONTRACT_SUCCESSOR_CHAIN` in
`check_governance.py`. The owner performs it by writing exactly

    ADOPT CONTRACT READABILITY RESTYLE: <sha256>

where the argument is the sha256 of the package manifest *file*
`candidates/contract-readability-restyle/CONTRACT-AMENDMENT-MANIFEST.txt`,
built and verified by `scripts/build_contract_readability_restyle.py`.

The recorder is pinned to the reviewed package, like its siblings
(`record_pwb_state1_amendment.py`, `record_polaris_understanding_adoption.py`):

- `FROZEN_MANIFEST_SHA`: the manifest-file digest the confirming review
  examined and the owner is offered;
- `REVIEW` / `REVIEW_SHA`: that review's retained raw, by path and sha256.
  Its head, the first four non-blank lines, must carry
  `Verdict: CONFIRM` or `Verdict: CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS` and
  `Manifest SHA-256: <FROZEN_MANIFEST_SHA>`. Here the act argument *is* the
  manifest file's digest (there is no separate row digest), so the raw's
  `Manifest SHA-256` line carries exactly the argument the owner speaks.

All three are `None` until the package and its confirming review exist; they
are set in the change that freezes the package, never inferred. `--record`
refuses while any pin is `None`, when the owner's phrase is not the exact
`LABEL: <sha256>` form, when its argument differs from the current manifest
digest, when that digest differs from the pin, when the raw's sha or head
differ, or when the package does not verify unapplied. The order is fixed:
record first, then `build_contract_readability_restyle.py --apply
--at-adoption` in the same change (the builder refuses to apply without
these records).

`--record --phrase "<owner phrase verbatim>"` writes the dedicated act record
and appends one marked section to `ACCEPTANCE-ACT-RECORD.md`. Each carries the
owner's phrase once, as the only line that contains the label (CG-7h requires
exactly one bare full-line occurrence per record).

`--check` verifies the pins, that the dedicated record regenerates exactly,
and that the aggregate holds exactly one copy of the marked block; it reports
"not performed" and exits 0 when neither record exists, and fails on a partial
record. `--selftest` runs fixtures in temporary directories, including one
over a real, verifying package built by the builder's own fixture.

Owner: Tzeusy

Act instant: {instant}

Project identity: project:syzygy

Artifact identity: contract:syzygy:rfc-0001-0009:readability-restyle

Act type: adopt contract amendment (successor to the general trusted-bootstrap contract manifest)

Provenance: owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)

A1 audit-record identity: explicitly absent

The owner performed the act by writing exactly:

```text
{LABEL}: {sha}
```

The argument is the sha256 of {MANIFEST}. It was recomputed at recording,
matched the phrase, and equals the reviewed digest the recorder pins.

Confirming review: {pins.review} (sha256 {pins.review_sha})

The manifest binds the exact post-restyle bytes of 29 of the 30 accepted
RFC 0001-0009 modules, every one except rfcs/RFC-0007/rendering-and-surface.md.

Scope: readability restyle only. Clause identities, clause leads, front
matter and headings are unchanged by construction (the package builder
verifies all three); the installed and candidate mirrors take the same bytes.

Supersession relationship: link 2 of the contract successor chain. For its 29
paths it supersedes the current-byte rows of the general trusted-bootstrap
contract manifest, and of any earlier performed chain link, which remain
preserved as act-time history. RFC-0007's rendering module stays bound where
it was.

Revocation relationship: none. This act grants no implementation, source,
provider, write, deployment or release permission.

This is bootstrap owner provenance, not independent authorship verification,
runtime evidence or product readiness.
