"""Record/check an owner's version-tagged sign-off of a candidate package.

Scope A of `decisions/OWNER-DIRECTION-VERSIONED-SIGNOFF-SCOPE-A-2026-10-02.md`:
for implementation-phase governed artifacts the owner signs off by selecting an
option in a structured question that names the package and a `major.minor`
version. No typed phrase and no digest argument exists. The sign-off binds a
git tag, `<package>-v<major>.<minor>`, on the commit that carries the applied
result; a later edit is a new version, never a retirement of the earlier one.

`--record <package> --version M.m --date YYYY-MM-DD --review <raw>
--owner-selection-quote "<the option label and question the owner answered>"`
validates, in this order, and writes nothing until every step passes:

1. the version is `major.minor` (no leading zeros) and the date a calendar
   form; the owner's selection quote is one non-empty line carrying no
   64-hex digest;
2. the version is not already recorded for the package;
3. the review raw's first four non-blank lines carry exactly one
   `Reviewed commit: <40 hex>`, one `Manifest SHA-256: <64 hex>` and one
   `Verdict:` line, which is `CONFIRM` or `CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`; REVISE or
   any other verdict refuses. A package that declares its reviewed `subject`
   is bound by that head digest: it must equal the sha256 of the subject's
   bytes in the working tree, before anything is applied. The reviewed commit
   is provenance and the base of step 5's comparison, never the binding; a
   rebase-merged review commit stays fetchable from its pull request's ref.
   The raw must also name the package's key, or the `review_alias` the
   package declares (its builder's script), so a review of another package
   cannot be offered for this one. A raw judging two packages at once carries
   a two-package head instead: its first six non-blank lines hold exactly one
   `Reviewed commit:` line and, for exactly two distinct labels, one
   `<LABEL> manifest SHA-256: <64 hex>` and one `<LABEL> verdict:` line each;
   a package declaring that `head_label` binds by its own two lines only, and
   an unlabelled manifest or verdict line beside them, any other head line
   naming a verdict or a digest, a half-labelled or repeated label, or a
   package with no label or a label the head lacks refuses as ambiguous. A
   package with no manifest (`package_digest`) binds instead by one
   `Package digest: <64 hex>` line in place of the manifest line: it must
   equal `sha256sum $(git ls-files <candidate dir> | LC_ALL=C sort) |
   sha256sum` over exactly the files the reviewed commit tracked there, each
   hashed from the working tree (a sibling disposition record added since is
   outside that set). A head carrying both digest lines, or more than one
   `Package digest:` line, refuses as ambiguous; a `Package digest:` head
   binds no package that has a manifest, and a manifest head never binds a
   `package_digest` package. Such a package's record carries its applied
   subject rows in manifest row form, in place of a manifest. A
   package signed under a plain owner direction extending Scope A names that
   direction (`extension`), which must exist;
4. for `CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`, the raw's `## Findings` section numbers its
   findings continuously as `**Finding N — title** (blocking|revise|note)`,
   where the severity word may carry a qualifier after it ("(note, for the
   owner)", "(note: reported for the owner, not resolved)"); the leading
   word is the severity, and a `note` whose qualifier names "blocking" or
   "revise" is refused as ambiguous rather than read either way; every
   finding is a `note`. A note's qualifier fails closed: it is read as a note
   only when each comma-separated clause is one of `QUALIFIER_CLAUSES`
   ("for the owner", "for the owner's view", "reported for the owner", "not
   resolved", "editorial"), and any other wording refuses as ambiguous; and `--disposition <record>` names the raw on a
   `Reviewed record:` line and numbers exactly the raw's findings. For either
   verdict the `## Findings` section is read and fails closed: a line that
   opens a finding in any other form (a heading, a bullet, an `F<n>` label),
   or a blocking or revise severity written as a tag (first in parentheses or
   brackets, or after `Severity:`) that the classifier did not consume,
   refuses; a bare `CONFIRM` over a blocking or revise finding refuses as
   self-contradictory. A package may declare the opening line of a
   prior-round recap that closes the raw's findings section
   (`findings_end`); findings are then read before it only, the opener must
   occur exactly once, and a finding or blocking/revise tag inside the recap
   refuses. The package key or alias binds only as a whole token
   on a line outside any fenced block, never as part of a longer name;
5. the candidate package directory, and any further directory the package
   declares (a specification change under `openspec/changes/`), at the
   working tree equals the package at the commit the review read (sibling
   `ROUND-<n>-DISPOSITIONS.md` records inside the candidate directory, and
   the named disposition, are not package bytes; in a further directory
   every file is);
6. the package's own builder check passes on the unapplied package.

Then the package's patches are applied through its builder, the dedicated
record `decisions/<STEM>-SIGNOFF-v<M.m>.md` is written (for a package that
installs a registry entry, naming that entry and the SHA-256 of its installed
bytes, which `--check` re-hashes), one marked block is
appended to `ACCEPTANCE-ACT-RECORD.md`, and the tag to create is printed.

`--check <package> --version M.m` reports "not performed" and exits 0 when no
record exists, fails on a partial record, re-validates the review head and
findings, regenerates the record and the aggregate block exactly, and, when the
version is the package's latest, requires the applied tree. `--selftest` runs
a mutation fixture per predicate in temporary git repositories.

The owner signed off version {version} of `{pkg.candidate.as_posix()}` by the
selection quoted above. The review named above read the package bytes this
sign-off applies; the recorder confirmed that the package directory still
equals the package at the reviewed commit (disposition records excepted) and
{checked_phrase(pkg)}

The binding is the annotated tag `{tag_for(pkg, version)}` on the commit that
carries this record and the applied result. A later edit to the package is a
new version signed separately; it does not retire this one.
