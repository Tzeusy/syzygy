"""Record or verify the owner's RFC5-14 `project-documentation` amendment act.

Package `contracts/candidates/rfc5-project-documentation-class/`. One
state-(1) owner act over the one row of `CONTRACT-AMENDMENT-MANIFEST.txt`: the
SHA-256 of `rfcs/RFC-0005/consent-egress-secrets.md` with the package patch
applied. The recommended form (packet, option 1) is an option selection that
names the record "at its manifest row"; no phrase is typed and no digest
appears in any Markdown file of the package. This script performs nothing by
itself, and it refuses to record anything unless `FROZEN_SUBJECT` names the
commit a confirming review read.

WHICH DIGEST. The act argument is the manifest ROW (the proposed-bytes
digest). The review raw's head `Manifest SHA-256:` carries the digest of the
manifest FILE; those are different values for this one-row manifest, and this
recorder checks each against the one it names. The manifest's own header
sentence ("names this file's digest") describes the typed-phrase form; it is
not edited here, and `reviews/ROUND-2-DISPOSITIONS.md` says why.

NOT REGISTERED IN check_governance.py. The row hashes proposed bytes, so it
equals the installed module's digest only after the install. Registering that
module as a CG-7d subject now makes the restyle and active manifests' rows for
the same path read as stale copies of this act's argument (CG-7e fails, tried
2026-10-04). The package carries no digest anywhere else, so there is no copy
to go stale; register the phrase in the install change, when subject and row
agree.

`--record ARGUMENT --date D --question-opening Q --selection-label L
--selection-description S` requires, before anything is written:

1. the argument is a 64-hex SHA-256 equal to the manifest's one row, the
   manifest rows are exactly the builder's one module, and the builder
   verifies (so a stale manifest or another digest is refused);
2. the subject bytes (the patched module, or the installed module once the
   patch is applied) hash to the argument;
3. the frozen commit carries the manifest, the patch, the packet, the brief,
   the delta and the ledger exactly as presented (the packet may gain one
   PERFORMED head), and the packet carries no 64-hex token;
4. the confirming raw's first four non-blank lines carry
   `Reviewed commit: <40 hex>`, `Manifest SHA-256: <SHA-256 of the manifest
   FILE>` and a verdict of `CONFIRM` or `CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`; the latter
   clears the bytes only when every finding is a `note` and the sibling
   `ROUND-2-DISPOSITIONS.md` names the raw and dispositions every finding;
5. the owner's selection (opening, label, description) is non-empty, one line
   each, and carries no 64-hex digest.

It then writes the dedicated record and one `ACCEPTANCE-ACT-RECORD.md`
section. It does NOT apply the patch: installing the proposed bytes in both
mirrors and regenerating what CG-7h and the contract index name belong in the
same change as the act record (packet, "Which act form"). `--check`
re-derives the record and counts exactly one copy of the block.
`--selftest` mutates each predicate and requires it to fail closed.

Owner: Tzeusy

Act identity: `{identity_for(date)}`

Project identity: `project:syzygy`

Artifact identity: `.syzygy/governance/contracts/{MODULE}`

Exact digest (SHA-256): `{argument}`

Provenance state: `owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)` — state (1),
explicitly selected by the owner's option selection recorded below

Supersession / revocation: none recorded by this act. This act is revoked only
by a later exact owner act naming it.

A1 audit-record identity (RFC3-16(b) item 9): **explicitly absent**

## Ceremony

The owner was presented the confirmed packet at
`{PACKET_REL.as_posix()}`, which by design carries no digest. The act takes
this phrase, whose argument is the one row of the package manifest (the
SHA-256 of the module with the package patch applied):

```text
{phrase_for(argument)}
```

The owner did not type the phrase. On {date} the owner answered a structured
question in the Claude Code CLI that opened "{sel.opening}" by selecting the
option below; the selection is the instruction, and it names the record "at its
manifest row". The label and description, verbatim:

| Label | Description |
|---|---|
| "{sel.label}" | "{sel.description}" |

The argument was read from the row of `{MANIFEST_REL.as_posix()}` at the frozen
commit and matched the patched module at recording. A swapped argument would
have been refused. The manifest header's sentence that rows bind "by the owner
act that names this file's digest" describes the typed-phrase form; this act
binds the row, as the packet's option 1 says.

Frozen provenance:

- frozen subject (package bytes): `{frozen}`;
- manifest file SHA-256: `{manifest_sha}` (a different value from the row);
- confirmation review: `{CONFIRMATION_REVIEW_REL.as_posix()}`, verdict
  `{verdict}`, its head bound to the manifest file's SHA-256 above; notes, if
  any, are dispositioned in `{DISPOSITION_REL.as_posix()}`; the raw names
  reviewed commit `{reviewed}` [Observed — the raw's own line; binding is by
  digest]; and
- recording tag: `{tag_for(date)}`, on the commit carrying this act record.

## Effect

{EFFECT}

## What this act does not authorize

It satisfies only its own authority. It amends no other clause, doctrine or
policy, edits no act-bound specification, and grants no consent, read, egress,
write, execution, deployment, release, autonomous or multi-user authority. The
sentence in the Polaris generator source policy that lists the six classes is
not edited by it; its propagation is the owner's separate choice recorded in
the packet.
