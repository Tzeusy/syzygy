"""Generate DIRECTIVE-REGISTER.md — every governing identifier, and where it is defined.

This repository governs by identifier. `AGENTS.md` says "cite by identifier",
and eight families of them are in use across five trees. Until now no page said
which identifiers exist or where each one is defined, so the only way to find a
clause was to know already. Two of the in-force craft policies make that worse:
they live at a path named `policy-candidates/`, under filenames ending
`-CANDIDATE.md`, behind their own head banners saying they bind nothing. A
reader who scanned `policies/craft-and-care/` would conclude CC-SPEC and
CC-IMPACT do not exist.

This generator answers exactly one question — *where is this identifier
defined?* — and refuses to answer any other. It carries the identifier, its
definition site, and the short title **the corpus itself marks up** at that
site. It never carries a clause body, never paraphrases, and never extracts a
title out of running prose: a title is read only from a Markdown heading or a
bold run, which is a structural marker an author placed deliberately. Where
the corpus marks no title, the register prints an em dash and the reader opens
the file. `AGENTS.md`: *a generator that quotes prose has re-opened the door it
closed.*

Three guards keep it honest, and each fails generation rather than degrading:

  * A definition site must be a heading or a leading bold run. A line like
    ``RFC1-1's zero-roots rule (cited, not restated) surfaces …`` starts with
    the identifier and is *not* a definition; the strict rule rejects it, and
    `--selftest` holds that exact line as a fixture.
  * `NAME_MAX` caps the marked-up title. A title long enough to be a body is a
    sign the markup convention has drifted; generation stops and names the file
    and line rather than truncating in silence.
  * An identifier cited inside a family's own files but defined nowhere in them
    is reported as such, never guessed at and never quietly dropped.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/build_directive_register.py            # (re)write the register
  python3 scripts/build_directive_register.py --check    # drift check, no write
  python3 scripts/build_directive_register.py --selftest # mutation fixtures
