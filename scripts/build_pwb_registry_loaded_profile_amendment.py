"""Build and verify the inert PWB registry loaded-profile amendment.

This script performs no owner act and writes no act record. Its subject is
the Polaris Butlers project-shape observer registry entry, whose current
bytes are the argument of a performed `adopt-registry-entry` act. The
proposed bytes therefore live only as one unified diff under `proposed/`.

The diff is drafted on top of the `syzygy-dov.18` currency-and-briefing
candidate, which edits the same subject. The order of the two acts is a
constraint of this builder, not an owner ruling: `--apply` refuses until
`.18` has been applied. `--check` builds the base the same way whichever
state the tree is in:

- `.18` not yet adopted: current bytes, then `.18`'s patch, then this one;
- `.18` adopted (the subject hashes to `.18`'s manifest row): current bytes,
  then this patch alone;
- this package adopted (the subject hashes to this manifest's own row): the
  base is recovered by reversing this patch, and `--apply` refuses.

Either way the manifest row is the digest a superseding
`adopt-registry-entry` act would take as its argument. It matches the tree
only after `--apply --at-adoption`.

The fields this package adds restate the source grammar the observer
applies today. `--check` tests that three ways. The six existing grammar
keys and every other entry field are unchanged, and every sentence is pinned
to the text below. Every heading literal is present in the specification's
reader definitions, and the root index path, pillar keys, labels, bindings
and tree patterns match the constants in `packages/three-surface-poc-core/src/`.
And the observer's own code, run under Node over files built from the
profile's fields alone, derives the source manifest and reads the items the
profile predicts, while one probe per exercised clause feeds it a varied
file and checks the outcome the clause states. The sentences themselves are
prose; a clause no probe exercises is checked only by its pin. The constants
cross-check is retired by the change that deletes the constants (M8 slice 5
limb 5), which then owns the loaded-profile test itself.

Bare invocation refuses to overwrite the manifest; pass `--write`.

# Witness 3: the observer's own code, run over files built from the profile.

# The builder writes a small repository whose every file is generated from
# the proposed fields alone: the root index from `rootIndex` and `pillars`,
# each pillar index and named file from `sourcePopulation` and the grammar
# rows, the tree populations from their path patterns. It predicts, from the
# same fields, the source manifest and every item the observer should read,
# then runs the real `deriveProjectShapeManifest` and `extractSource` from
# `packages/three-surface-poc-core/src/` under Node and compares. A row that
# names the wrong heading, level, source, column, table, field, pattern,
# companion or index file makes the prediction and the code disagree.
#
# The sentences cannot be run, so each one is pinned to the text below, and
# each clause a probe exercises must appear in its sentence: the probe feeds
# the code one deliberately varied file and checks the outcome the clause
# states.
