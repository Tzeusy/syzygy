"""Build and verify the inert PWB behaviour-contract re-pin package.

Bead `syzygy-jloi`; package
`contracts/candidates/pwb-behavior-contract-repin/`. This script performs no
owner act and writes no act record.

Two governed artifacts pin `governingBehaviorContract.version` to the PWB
`spec.md` of the 2026-09-05 truth-and-readiness act, and say in `signedBy`
that the act is still pending: the observer registry entry (argument of the
2026-09-30 `adopt-registry-entry` act) and the secret-classification policy
(argument of the 2026-09-05 `approve-policy` amendment act). Every PWB
specification change since has moved `spec.md`, so both pins name superseded
bytes. The package re-pins both to the `spec.md` digest the current signed
PWB package (`pwb-readability-successor` v1.0) carries as its manifest row,
and names that sign-off in `signedBy`. Nothing else in either file moves.

Each subject keeps the act in force over it until its own superseding act is
performed: the proposed bytes live only as one unified diff per subject under
`proposed/`, and the two-row `PWB-EFFECT-REPIN-MANIFEST.txt` hashes the bytes
those diffs produce. Each row is the argument a superseding act over that
subject would take; neither row binds the other.

`--check` verifies, per subject:

- before its act (no superseding record): the subject hashes to the exact
  digest of the act in force, the patch applies, and the result satisfies the
  package's structural claims; the pinned digest is also the current `spec.md`
  (a package drafted over a superseded spec is stale and must be redrafted);
- after its act (the superseding record exists): reversing the patch over the
  subject yields the predecessor act's bytes, so the tree carries exactly the
  proposed bytes;
- always: the manifest is the exact regeneration over the proposed bytes, and
  `proposed/` holds exactly the two declared patches.

`--selftest` copies every input into a scratch tree and mutates each predicate
in turn, requiring the check to fail; it also drives the post-act mode with a
synthetic record.

Review-head contract (for the recorder that is written after the review, as
`record_pwb_registry_currency_amendment.py` was): the raw's first four
non-blank lines carry exactly one `Reviewed commit: <40 hex>`, one
`Manifest SHA-256: <64 hex>` naming the SHA-256 of the manifest FILE
`PWB-EFFECT-REPIN-MANIFEST.txt` (which carries both act arguments as rows),
and one `Verdict:` line reading `CONFIRM` or `CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`.
Findings are numbered `**Finding N — title** (blocking|revise|note)`.
`--manifest-digest` prints the value that line must carry.

Bare invocation refuses to overwrite the manifest; `--write` regenerates it,
which changes both act arguments and retires any review bound to the old one.
