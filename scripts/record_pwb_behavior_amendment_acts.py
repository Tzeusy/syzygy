"""Record or verify an owner-signed PWB behavior-amendment act (table-driven).

Each entry in `ACTS` is one candidate package over the eleven-artifact PWB
behavior population whose act would be a new link in the successor chain
(`PWB_SUCCESSOR_CHAIN` in `scripts/check_governance.py`). The act phrase is
`<LABEL>: <sha256 of the package's behavior manifest>`; the manifest rows
hash the PROPOSED bytes, so the act and the application of the package's
`proposed/*.patch` are one change.

This script performs nothing by itself. `--record` accepts the owner's
exact argument, recomputes it from the manifest bytes, checks that the
frozen subject, the presented packet and the confirmation review all bind
the same manifest digest, applies the package's patches through its own
builder (`--apply --at-adoption` semantics), confirms every manifest row
now hashes the tree, and writes the dedicated act record and one aggregate
section of `ACCEPTANCE-ACT-RECORD.md`. `--check` re-derives both records
from the tree after adoption and requires exactly one copy of the aggregate
block (later acts append after it). `--selftest` mutates each predicate and
requires it to fail closed.

Pins. Each entry's `frozen_subject` is the commit on `main` whose manifest
and packet bytes the offered phrase binds. Whenever a package's manifest is
regenerated (a later-landing package re-derives `GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.md`
and its row moves), the argument changes, the packet copy is re-derived,
a fresh confirmation review is needed, and this entry's pins are re-set —
never edited into agreement by hand. Review commits are cited as the raw
states them; review binding is by manifest digest, because a rebase-merge
can leave a branch-head commit reachable from no ref.

The successor-chain link and the existence-gated copy registrations in
`check_governance.py` are the performing change's to add; this script
prints what it knows and edits no check.

Confirmation-review head contract. `validate_packet` reads only the first
four lines of the confirmation review (blank lines count as lines; nothing
below line 4 is read) and accepts exactly one of two cases, per
`.syzygy/governance/decisions/POLARIS-GATE-SITTING-2026-09-26-DECISION.md`
§1 ("When a confirmation review clears a package's bytes"):

- **Case (a) — CONFIRM.** The head carries an exact line `Verdict: CONFIRM`,
  an exact line `Manifest SHA-256: <the offered argument>`, and a line
  matching `Reviewed commit: <40-hex sha>`. Unchanged from before this
  decision; a CONFIRM-only act's rendered bytes are byte-identical to what
  this script rendered before this change (see `--selftest`).
- **Case (b) — CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS, notes only.** The head carries an
  exact line `Verdict: CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`, the same
  `Manifest SHA-256:` and `Reviewed commit:` lines as case (a), AND the
  `Act` entry names a `disposition_record` path AND a `disposition_sha256`
  pin (see "Pinning" below), AND that disposition record (its bytes read
  directly from the tree; never git-blob-pinned, only hash-pinned)
  satisfies every one of:
    - its current bytes hash to exactly the Act's `disposition_sha256`
      (a mismatch, or an Act naming `disposition_record` with no
      `disposition_sha256` at all, each refuses with its own distinct
      message, before any content check below runs);
    - it exists;
    - it carries an exact line `Reviewed record: <the raw's repo path,
      exactly as `act.confirmation_review` names it>`;
    - it carries an exact line `Manifest SHA-256: <the offered argument>`;
    - it carries an exact line `Revise-severity findings: 0` (any other
      digit, or the line's absence, refuses — this is the only accepted
      zero-count line form);
    - the `Act` names the raw's exact `raw_findings_heading`; after fenced
      code is stripped, that byte-exact ATX heading must occur exactly once,
      and the raw scan is confined to its section (through the next ATX
      heading of equal or higher rank, or EOF). Missing, malformed or repeated
      headings refuse; there is no whole-document fallback. Within that slice,
      read the raw's finding markers, recognizing BOTH a line-leading form
      `^(\d+)\.\s` (MULTILINE) AND a bold form `^\*\*Finding (\d+)\b`
      (MULTILINE) — the real P-71 opening-band-scenario raws (rounds 1–10)
      open every finding `**Finding <n> — ...` and carry zero line-leading
      markers, so recognizing only the first form reads their finding count
      as 0 and the (then-vacuous) predicate would hold for any disposition,
      including an empty one (found against the real round-10 raw while
      hardening this predicate, `syzygy-qqt`). Both forms are read after
      first stripping every CommonMark-fenced code block from that text —
      a fence opens on a line of 3-or-more backticks or tildes (indented at
      most 3 spaces; a backtick fence's info string may not itself contain
      a backtick) and closes only on a later line of the *same* character,
      similarly indented, whose run length is at least the opening fence's;
      an unclosed fence runs to end of text. This stripping runs on BOTH
      the raw and the disposition before either is scanned, so a numbered
      line inside a fenced example cannot inflate the raw's finding count
      nor stand in for a real disposition. Indented (4-space) code blocks
      are NOT stripped — this corpus never opens a numbered list at column
      0 inside one, and stripping by indentation risks swallowing a
      genuinely indented continuation of a real finding. The raw's finding
      set is the exact set of numbers either form yields inside the selected
      stripped section — NOT the contiguous run `{1, ..., N}` starting at 1:
      findings
      are numbered continuously across a package's review rounds (round 11
      of that same package opens at 49), so a later round's raw carries no
      finding 1 at all and a `{1..N}`-from-1 predicate would refuse a
      legitimate record. A number that opens more than one line in the same
      text (raw or disposition, independently) is a parse failure, refused
      with its own message, not a re-used finding number. A raw whose
      verdict is CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS but whose finding set parses empty
      is refused with its own distinct message — a notes-only verdict with
      no countable note is a parse failure, not a vacuous pass. The
      disposition's own finding set — read over its own stripped text with
      one further form, an ATX heading `^#{2,6} (\d+) — ` (MULTILINE,
      levels 2–6, the exact em dash; disposition-record-only) in addition
      to the raw's two forms — must equal the raw's finding set exactly —
      not a superset or a subset. The heading form exists because a real
      disposition record beside the package
      (`.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/pwb-opening-band-scenario/ROUND-11-DISPOSITIONS.md`)
      opens every one of its entries `### <n> — ...` and cannot be
      rewritten to carry either raw-recognized marker; it is read only on
      the disposition side; a raw opening a line this way still counts 0
      for it.
  Any other combination (a REVISE-style verdict, a missing or malformed
  disposition, a missing or mismatched `disposition_sha256` pin, a digest
  mismatch, a nonzero revise count, an unmatched finding, a missing or
  ambiguous raw findings section, a raw with zero countable findings, a
  duplicated finding number in either text, or case (b) with no
  `disposition_record` configured on the Act) refuses with a specific error.
  The `opening-band` entry names both (wired 2026-10-01, reviewed in
  `docs/reviews/R-PWB-RECORDER-NOTES-ONLY-OPENING-BAND-WIRING-REVIEW-RAW.md`).

Split-phrase packets. An Act may set `split_phrase_packet=True` when its
owner packet shows the label and the digest apart: the label in a code span
and exactly one `Manifest SHA-256:` heading whose next non-blank line is the
digest in a code span, bound to the argument. Fenced code and HTML comments
are blanked first, and the packet may not also carry a whole
`LABEL: digest` phrase. The label check cannot tell a real offering from an
incidental mention, so the session that records the act must show the owner
the whole phrase.

Pinning. `disposition_sha256` is the full sha256 of the disposition
record's bytes, set once when an Act's package is drafted with a
`disposition_record` — exactly like `frozen_subject` and `packet_head` are
fixed at drafting time from committed bytes, never recomputed from
whatever the live tree happens to hold and trusted on that basis alone.
Without this pin a disposition record — read live, with no CC-REV-6
`-RAW.md` convention protecting it from edits — could be edited after the
ceremony and `--check` would silently re-verify the new bytes, never the
ones anyone reviewed (finding 8,
`docs/reviews/R-PWB-RECORDER-NOTES-ONLY-REVIEW-RAW.md`). Documentation
only: finding 6 of that same raw found the analogous self-computed
CONFIRM-only render-byte-identity hashes hard-coded in `selftest()`
insufficient, standing alone, as evidence that this script's rendering is
byte-identical to the pre-case-(b) code — they only guard *future* drift
from this commit onward, not a bug already present in it. The same is true
in reverse of any digest this script computes from its own live read: the
byte-identity evidence a dispute over a disposition's pin would need is an
origin/main diff of the record's rendered bytes, not a hash recomputed
here and checked against itself.

A1 audit-record identity (RFC3-16(b) item 9): **explicitly absent**

## Ceremony

The owner was presented the independently confirmed packet at
`{act.packet.as_posix()}`
and performed the offered indivisible behavior amendment by writing exactly:

```text
{phrase_for(act, argument)}
```

The argument is the SHA-256 of
`{act.manifest.as_posix()}`.
It was recomputed at recording and matched the phrase. The manifest bytes
were verified against frozen subject `{act.frozen_subject}`; the package's
patches were applied through its builder in the same change, and all eleven
rows were then verified to hash the tree. The presented packet bytes were
verified against the packet head. The act instant is the moment the owner
wrote the phrase, in-interaction, on {date}.

Frozen provenance:

- frozen subject (manifest and packet bytes): `{act.frozen_subject}`;
- owner-packet head: `{act.packet_head}`;
{review_bullet}
- recording tag: `{tag_for(act, date)}`, on the commit carrying this act record.

## Effect

{act.effect}

This act is the latest link over the eleven-artifact PWB behavior
population. Every earlier act's rows remain immutable act-time history;
none is edited, retired or re-hashed by this record.

## Signed artifacts

| Repository-relative artifact | sha256 |
|---|---|
{artifact_table}

All eleven rows take effect together or none do. An edit to any listed
artifact breaks this act's digest binding and must use the amendment path.

## What this act does not authorize

{act.not_authorized}

It approves no policy, adopts no registry entry, widens no consent, and
grants no write, egress, observed-code execution, deployment, release,
recovery, mission, second repository, wider content class, autonomous
behavior or multi-user support. It proves no read, screening, parse, render,
answer or comprehension result. It does not edit the signed parent
`three-surface-poc-experience` artifacts, accept RFC 0010 or RFC 0011, amend
doctrine, or start automatic follow-on work.
