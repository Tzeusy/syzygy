"""Build and verify the inert Three-Surface POC vocabulary and epistemic-record amendment.

Ruling P-75 (2026-09-21) directed one CC-REV-2 amendment against the
three-surface-poc-experience specification alone. The first package drafted
under it (``three-surface-poc-identity-amendment/``, register row P-84) was
parked by the owner on 2026-10-14 after six REVISE rounds, and redrafted
narrower: this package carries POC-REQ-055 (every relationship is a
closed-vocabulary name in a role pair the table assigns it, or flagged
outside it) and an in-place amendment to POC-REQ-060 (one epistemic record
shape on every entity and relationship, and the Inferred label). The subject
identity requirement (POC-REQ-054) and the three-state ribbon are deferred
and must not appear here. The signed bytes are never edited while this
package is a candidate: proposed bytes live as patches, and the manifest
hashes the six-artifact subject after those patches. Applying them is a
sign-off-time operation.

    --check      verify patches, structure, regeneration and the manifest
    --selftest   rule-6 mutants for the structure predicates, the two
                 subject-change predicates, patch drift, manifest order and
                 subject drift; each mutant names the one finding it must
                 produce, and the selftest fails if any REQUIRED_PHRASES,
                 COVERAGE_ROW_PHRASES, UNKNOWN_ROWS or READER_NOTE_PHRASES
                 entry has no mutant of its own. Sentences outside those
                 guards are frozen by the manifest digest, not by a phrase.
    --write      regenerate the manifest over the proposed bytes
    --diff       print the proposed patches
    --apply --at-adoption   write the proposed bytes (sign-off change only)

Guards, each a predicate the selftest mutates:

- the requirement population is the signed one plus POC-REQ-055 before
  POC-REQ-060; every other requirement block is byte-identical;
- POC-REQ-055 and POC-REQ-060 carry every phrase REQUIRED_PHRASES names,
  and cite the ruling's decision key; POC-REQ-060's signed scenario is kept
  verbatim;
- no proposed subject names POC-REQ-054, the deferred identity requirement;
- every signed reader-notes line survives except READER_NOTE_EDITS, whose
  replacements READER_NOTE_PHRASES checks;
- the one signed coverage row ruling P-75 Q3 names survives byte for byte;
  every other signed row survives, except the one Part B2 belief that moves
  (MOVED_FROM_B2); every added row carries AMENDMENT_MARK; the rows
  UNKNOWN_ROWS names exist once each and are Unknown; the rows
  COVERAGE_ROW_PHRASES names carry their justification;
- every other signed line of the matrix and of the proposal survives,
  except the computed figures COMPUTED_LINES names and the table rows the
  totals and row checks cover; the printed totals equal computation;
- the generated GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.md equals regeneration.
