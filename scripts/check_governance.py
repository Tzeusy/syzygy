"""Repository-wide governance checks for Syzygy — read-only, portable.

Run from the repository root:

    python3 scripts/check_governance.py

Exit status: 0 = no findings, 1 = at least one FAIL finding, 2 = usage error.

Design constraints (charter §17, "public, portable validation"):

  * **Repository-relative.** The repo root is derived from this file's own
    location, and **no founder-machine absolute path is ever resolved**. The
    only ones present are inert fixture *inputs* CG-19 exists to reject (see
    `--selftest` cases F4b, F5a, F5b); no filesystem access occurs against
    them. The earlier form of this sentence — "no founder-machine absolute
    path appears anywhere" — was false against three lines of this file, in
    a repository whose own term registry says an artifact must not contradict
    itself in the first line and the third (review RD-17, finding 12).
  * **Standard library only**, Python 3.9+. No installs, no network.
  * **Read-only.** This script never writes, moves, or rewrites a governance
    artifact. When a check finds a defect it *reports* it; correcting a
    normative artifact is a human act under the normative-change workflow.
  * **Every summary line states its denominator.** A check that examined zero
    items reports WARN — "PASS over nothing examined" is the failure mode this
    project exists to prevent (VIS-2: no evidence yields Unknown, never green).
  * **Allowlists are declared inline, counted, and printed.** A silent
    exemption is indistinguishable from a missing check.

Checks
------
  CG-1   internal links and path references resolve; an active route into
         `rfcs/**` is a broken pointer, not a by-design absence (CG-1g)
  CG-2   retired acceptance phrases are confined, current ones carry live
         arguments even across a line wrap, and `about/` is absent from
         active instructions. Phrase population:
         `candidates/ACCEPTANCE-PHRASE-REGISTRY.yaml`
  CG-3   stale bootstrap routing (`_bootstrap/prompts/`) absent
  CG-4   candidate homes carry candidate banners (CG-4a) and claim no
         acceptance (CG-4b)
  CG-5   canonical craft banners are truthful
  CG-6   accepted homes do not exist yet (created only by owner acts)
  CG-7   ACTIVE-CONTRACT-MANIFEST and unperformed-wave row digests are
         current; performed-wave manifests match their recorded act arguments
         and all six path sets partition the active set; each wave row's
         stated module count matches its manifest (CG-7f);
         `wave-manifests/` holds exactly six (CG-7g)
  CG-8   default-load size and context budgets reported, never enforced
         (the default-load set and AGENTS.md band are this file's own
         operating figures; charter §11.4 decomposition triggers)
  CG-9   authority-home files sit under their one home (a path test, not
         a duplicate-content test)
  CG-10  pending-decision register as-of line reported
  CG-11  `.syzygy/cache/` and `.syzygy/local/` are git-ignored
  CG-12  no active artifact cites a `_bootstrap/` path as a required source
  CG-13  dependency edges resolve; a package README equals its module union
  CG-14  acceptance-record install sources and destinations are valid
  CG-15  truncated digest quotes still prefix a current argument
  CG-16  the term registry is never described as accepted
  CG-17  every RFC 0006-0011 clause is routed exactly once
  CG-18  context fixtures still recompute (digest and word count)
  CG-19  substrate pins are complete and well-formed; drift is consistent
         and carries a disposition
  CG-20  the routing artifacts state no measurement (advisory — the rule has
         no written owner yet; see CHECK_OWNERS)
  CG-21  contract prose states no measurement (advisory — same)
  CG-22  no unqualified `status` in the active lane — the term registry's
         five-dimension rule (§1, candidate), made executable; CG-22c checks
         the qualifier list still covers the registry's five dimensions
  CG-23  advanced vocabulary on the default public path, reported (the
         term registry's two-tier bound, candidate)
  CG-24  which check families have a `--selftest` fixture, computed
  CG-25  every check family names the authoritative rule it enforces
         (`CHECK_OWNERS`); a check whose rule lives only in this file is
         downgraded to WARN with the reason printed

`--selftest` runs a synthetic failing input against the checks that have a
fixture — **not against every check above**. That distinction is the point:
a validator never shown to fail is indistinguishable from a no-op, and this
repository has shipped one (charter §18). CG-24 computes which families are
covered and prints the denominator every run, so the claim cannot drift from
the fixture set the way a sentence does.

Status vocabulary: OK (examined > 0, no findings) · WARN (nothing examined, or
a report-only observation) · FAIL (findings that fail the run).

#: **Which written rule does this check enforce, and where does that rule
#: live?** Review RD-17 finding 11 swept the whole corpus for citations of a
#: `CG-\d+` identifier — 70 files, 692 citations — and found not one inside
#: doctrine, craft-and-care, or any contract module. The battery could not
#: distinguish, in its own output, a FAIL against adopted doctrine from a FAIL
#: against a candidate whose own banner says it binds nothing, and a reader
#: had no register to consult.
#:
#: An entry is one of three shapes, and the shape is the claim:
#:
#:   * an **identifier** (`VIS-2`, `SDR-9`, `RFC3-16`) plus the file that
#:     defines it — the check enforces adopted or owner-approved text;
#:   * `mechanical — …` — the check verifies self-consistency and needs no
#:     normative owner. A digest either matches its subject or does not;
#:     nobody has to rule on that.
#:   * `candidate: <path>` — the rule is written, but in material with no
#:     owner act. The FAIL still fires; the printed owner is what stops it
#:     reading as a doctrine breach.
#:
#: Keyed by check family. CG-25 fails the battery when a FAIL-capable check
#: reported this run has no entry here, so a new check cannot ship
#: unattributed.

    `tracked` is `git ls-files`. The default `clone` scope adds untracked

    before its first commit rather than after it. That is the reason now.
    The reason first written here — that the candidate governance package
    was untracked and a tracked-only corpus would give CG-4, CG-7, CG-8,
    CG-9 and CG-12 a zero denominator — expired when the package was
    committed (review RD-6 D-2, recorded 2026-10-03).

    The cost is that every denominator in a local run includes whatever
    untracked file is lying in the working tree, which a clone does not
    have. Both counts are printed in the scope line so the difference is
    never implicit, and the run of record — a clone, or the hosted job —
    has no untracked files, so there the two scopes agree.

    Returns (paths, tracked_set, source). `source` is "git" normally and
    "walk" when git is unavailable — an exported or archived copy of the
    tree, where the corpus is a filesystem walk and *nothing is known to be

    replaced the whole banner with a confident, well-formed claim that the

    craft since it was written, applied to the tree that has no acts at all.

    states its candidacy negatively — *"nothing here is accepted"*, *"No

#: offer: RD-6 noted that a file cannot be history for CG-15b and a live
#: offer for CG-7d at the same time. On 2026-08-10 every superseded round
#: record (`round-2026-08/FINAL-OWNER-ACCEPTANCE-RECORD.md` — always absent
#: here — plus the 08b record, the 08b public-clone report, and the 08c

#: The bare-copy *shape* every PWB owner packet and act record uses for
#: convenience, ahead of the phrase line CG-7d reads: a heading/label line
#: — optionally qualified ("Behavior manifest", "Effect manifest",
#: "Three-artifact manifest", "Eleven-artifact manifest", "Policy",
#: "Registry", "Exact offer", "Exact digest (") — ending in `SHA-256` (an
#: optional closing paren, then `:`), then the 64-hex digest: same line,
#: wrapped to the next, or after blank lines, and optionally wrapped in
#: backticks and/or `**bold**`. A stale copy in this shape passed CG-7d (no
#: phrase on the line) *and*, before bd-eau, CG-7e (predicate 1 only tested
#: "is the current digest present somewhere in the body", so a correct copy
#: of the phrase line elsewhere in the same file masked the corrupted bare
#: one). The first fix matched only the literal, unqualified "Manifest
#: SHA-256:" spelling; an independent review of that fix (R-CG7E-BARE-
#: DIGEST) found the identical corruption-masking bug live in 15 further
#: bare copies under every qualified spelling above, plus 5 more this
#: review then found under "Exact digest (SHA-256):" in the performed PWB
#: effect-act records. Its confirmation review (R-CG7E-BARE-DIGEST-
#: CONFIRMATION) found 5 more the uppercase, colon-terminated form missed:
#: a lowercase `sha256:` (one as a list item, one after a backticked
#: filename) and three bare `SHA-256 <digest>` lines with no colon. So the
#: label may follow a list/quote marker, may be backticked, may be empty,
#: `sha256`/`SHA-256` in any case, colon optional — 29 bare copies in 22 of
#: the 39 registered files over 12 spellings, 4 of them literal "Manifest
#: SHA-256:". Not headings, so deliberately unmatched: a digest cited inline
#: mid-sentence ("… (SHA-256 `<digest>`)", "verdict `CONFIRM`, sha256
#: `<digest>`"), which names a review raw or container file, not an act
#: argument (3 such in `pwb-effect-acts/OWNER-SIGNOFF-PACKET.md`). A third
#: review (R-CG7E-BARE-DIGEST-CONFIRMATION-2) found 12 copies of act
#: arguments with no sha256 label at all — `Act identity:` lines, table
#: cells, a checksum row, one owner phrase — masked by a correct copy
#: elsewhere in the file. Shape-matching cannot reach them; the
#: shape-independent near-miss pass (`STANDALONE_DIGEST`, bd `syzygy-wh1`)
#: does, for one-character corruption. The label text is captured
#: (group 1) so each match is validated against *that file's own* declared
#: digests (`allowed_bare`), never the whole corpus's recognized set — a
#: different file's correct digest must not excuse this one, and this
#: constant still cannot regress into RD-6's 47-false-finding hole: it
#: requires the line to end in `SHA-256` immediately before the colon, so
#: prose ("the SHA-256 argument binds…", "SHA-256 of the artifact itself")
#: and table cells ("| SHA-256 |", "SHA-256 of `path`,") never match.

    Two predicates, and the second is what keeps the first honest:

    1. **A registered current file carries that act's current argument; a
       registered historical file carries an actually performed argument.**
       The two populations are explicit because rewriting an append-only
       offering is as wrong as leaving a current owner packet stale.
    2. **A file carrying a recognized current or performed digest is
       registered.** An unregistered copy is unchecked from the moment it
       goes stale, which is exactly how the population escaped CG-7d.

    **Why not the simpler rule.** Review RD-6 (H-1) proposed treating every
    64-hex token as an act-argument copy. Tried: 47 findings, none of them
    defects — the corpus legitimately quotes digests of artifacts that are not
    act subjects (what D3 would amend, a superseded manifest a round record
    preserves, a per-file craft digest list). A check that cannot tell those
    from a stale act argument would have to be silenced to be usable, and a
    silenced check is the thing this battery exists to prevent.

    H-1's own mutation is what this closes: falsifying all four act arguments
    in the owner-facing offering left the battery at `0 findings, exit 0`.
    Under predicate 1 it removes four current digests from a file that names
    all four acts, and fails four times.

    """The performed transaction binds every current and nested subject.

    CG-7d permits old *performed* digests so append-only history remains true.
    That permission needs an inverse current-state predicate: the latest
    performed CC-SPEC digest and the performed transaction digest must match
    today's exact subjects, in both the append-only act record and the
    dedicated act record. The outer manifest's seven subjects, its nested
    30-row contract manifest, its nested five-row PWB manifest, and all 30
    installed/candidate contract pairs are then verified from their declared
    bases. The historical PWB rows continue to match current paths until a
    valid later owner act supersedes them. Only matching aggregate and
    dedicated successor records activate the eleven-row current manifest;
    candidate bytes alone never do. Successors form a chain
    (`PWB_SUCCESSOR_CHAIN`): the latest validly performed link binds current
    bytes, every earlier link is immutable act-time history, and a later
    link recorded without its predecessor is a gap, not a supersession.
    Contract successors form a second, independent chain
    (`CONTRACT_SUCCESSOR_CHAIN`). Each link's manifest binds exactly the
    link's own closed path tuple, in order (no missing, extra or reordered
    row, and every row a bootstrap row); its two records must each carry
    exactly one bare full-line `LABEL: <sha256>` agreeing with the
    manifest's actual digest. Chain order is adoption order: a link whose
    first aggregate record line falls after a later link's, or whose act
    instant (`_contract_link_instant`) is after or equal to a later link's,
    is a finding (performed out of order, or ambiguously ordered), never
    silently shadowed; a link without a single well-formed instant agreeing
    across both records is itself a finding, since the aggregate's position
    alone can be forged by a mid-file insertion. Valid links fold into
    the current-byte expectations in chain order (a later link overrides an
    earlier one per path); the installed and mirror loops then verify
    current bytes against the fold. Every earlier link with records that
    fail validation is a finding against each later performed link; an
    earlier link with no records is an allowed gap. Unsigned candidates
    never replace the original current-byte expectations.
    The specification-policy restyle is a separate successor to CC-SPEC's
    transaction row and to act 7. It is valid only when both records carry
    exactly one bare `LABEL: <sha256>` line agreeing with its two-row
    manifest, one recorder-generated `CC-…@<row>` line per row, one agreeing
    act instant, and both rows equal today's policy bytes. While valid, the
    transaction's CC-SPEC row and the bootstrap act's CC-SPEC record are
    act-time history; otherwise they stay current and today's bytes are
    compared against them. The latest performed CC-IMPACT digest in the
    aggregate must equal today's bytes whether or not the successor exists.
    `spec_policy_inputs`, when given, is `(dedicated record, manifest body,
    manifest digest)`; `impact_digest` replaces CC-IMPACT's current digest.
    `contract_chain_inputs`, when given, maps each link label to
    `(dedicated record, manifest body, manifest digest)`; an absent label
    reads as no records and no manifest. `contract_chain` replaces the chain
    itself (selftest only).
    Otherwise a correct outer ceremony could be reported over drifted nested
    bytes or an unsigned candidate could impersonate current authority.

    two commits past what the owner approved.

    network call and resolves nothing upstream. It establishes that each pin
    carries a complete, well-formed, non-machine-local locator that a human
    with network access can verify in one step, and that the lock is
    internally consistent. It does **not** and cannot establish that the named
    repository exists, that the named commit is reachable in it, that the
    repository is still public, or that the recorded digests match the bytes
    upstream. **A pin to a deleted repository at a fabricated commit passes
    this check by design** — fixture `F6e` is kept in `--selftest` for the sole
    purpose of keeping that boundary executable rather than merely written
    down. Upstream agreement is established only by the human step the lock
    records under `verification:`, and claimed only by a dated clone report.

    non-sole source, while this accepts *either* a derivation or a visible
    precedence banner. A check that under-enforces its clause is safe; one
    that over-enforces invents obligation nobody approved.

    It used to verify that the nineteen per-module word counts in package
    READMEs still recomputed. That is a real check and it found real defects
    — but it accepts the premise that a volatile measurement belongs inside a
    contract, and then tries to keep it true. The premise is the defect. These
    figures sit **inside act 1's digest set**: correcting one changes the
    argument the owner would sign, for a reason that has nothing to do with
    what the contract says.

    The history is four rounds long. Nineteen of nineteen module rows were
    stale in the commit whose own message claimed to have corrected every
    stale derived value. A hand repair then left nine more of the same class
    in the same file, stating module 1 as 6,996 in one place and 6,999 in
    another. The check written to close that class could not see the rows it
    was written for, and a reviewer mutation-tested it at `111,111` to prove
    so. Each round fixed the instances; none removed the reason instances
    keep appearing.

    So the rule is now: **a contract module states no measurement.** Sizes
    live in the generated `CONTEXT-BUDGET-REPORT.md`, which is regenerated
    rather than transcribed, and the compaction narrative lives in the round
    report that owns it. What stays in the contract is what it *says*.

    The denominator is the module count, never the figure count — a figure
    count goes to zero exactly when the rule is being honoured, and a check

    r"""A term as it actually appears on the default path.

    Two blind spots, both measured by review RD-16 finding 5 against the live
    corpus and both invisible to `\b<escaped name>\b`:

    * **line wrap.** `OVERVIEW.md` reads ``its **Project\nGenome**``, so
      `\bProject Genome\b` was `False` and T-03 went unreported while the
      term registry's §5 census presented "both current hits" as a census of
      what exists. Multi-word terms now join on `\s+`, the same tolerance
      CG-12 and CG-22 already apply to their own markers.
    * **inflection.** `Diff -->|warranted work| Fleet` is `Warrant` (T-17)
      inflected, and `an explicitly approved **Mission** envelope` is T-28's
      bare alias. A word-boundary match on the registry's own citation form
      sees neither.

    The final word takes an optional inflectional suffix; earlier words do
    not, because an inflected head inside a compound is a different term, not
    this one. The cost of matching loosely is handled the way this battery
    handles every widening — `VOCAB_ORDINARY_USE`, enumerated and printed —
    and CG-23 is report-only, so a false positive costs a printed line, never
    a failed run.

    **Known limit, third blind spot (RD-16 finding 5, recorded not repaired).**
    A term *defined in place* — "a **Warrant** — that is, an approved intent
    — …" — still reads as a leak here, because the matcher sees the token and
    not the gloss beside it. This is deliberate. The finding CG-23 exists to
    report is that the registry's own census *understated* the leak count, and
    widening the exemptions on a check whose defect was under-reporting is the
    wrong direction: a definition-marker vocabulary would be guessed, and a
    guessed exemption is how a real leak stops being printed. A reader
    disposing of one of these has the same tool everyone else does —
    `VOCAB_ORDINARY_USE`, one enumerated entry, printed every run. The limit
    is pinned by the fixture `CG-23 defined-in-place use is still reported
    (known limit)`, so a future silent change to it is visible.

# --------------------------------------------------------------- CG-24

#: "`--selftest` runs every check above against a synthetic failing input."
#: That sentence has been false for as long as it has been written, and two
#: independent reviews (RC-10 §7.2 vi, RC-11 RC11-G) raised it. The first
#: repair added twenty-nine fixtures — all clustered in the range that already
#: had coverage — which made the sentence *less* true as a proportion while
#: looking like a fix.
#:
#: A prose correction goes stale the next time a check is added. So the
#: denominator is computed instead: CG-24 reads the fixture names out of this
#: file's own `selftest()` and compares them against the identifiers the
#: battery actually reported this run. Adding a check with no fixture now
#: shows up here on the same run.
#: Fixture names read `"CG-19 private substrate detected"` or `"F8g CG-19 …"`;
#: the battery's own check names read `"CG-19  substrate pins …"` with two
#: spaces. The single-space lookahead is what separates a fixture from the
#: check it tests — without it every check would appear to cover itself.
#: A fixture may name a lettered sub-check (`CG-7e`, `CG-1b`) while the family
#: this check counts is the numeric stem. Admitting the suffix is what let the
#: first CG-7 fixture ever written be credited to CG-7; without it the fixture
#: existed and the coverage figure still reported the family uncovered.
#: **Anchored to `selftest()`'s own body, not to a quoting convention.**
#: The single-space lookahead below was doing the work of separating a fixture
#: name from a check name, and three string literals in this file broke the
#: two-space convention it rested on: `res.add("WARN", "CG-11 ignore rules"`,
#: `res.add("WARN", "CG-12b …")`, and a sentence about CG-11 inside a
#: `print`. All three were counted as fixtures, and CG-24 over-credited
#: itself by two families — `16 of 24` where the truth was `14 of 24` (review
#: RD-17 finding 3, mutation M9). CG-24's own fixture for exactly this
#: (*"a check's own name is not a fixture for it"*) passed, because its
#: synthetic input used the convention the real corpus did not.
#:
#: The anchor is now three conditions, and the third was earned the same day:
#: a fixture name must live inside the `selftest()` region, must open a tuple
#: or list element (`cases.append(("CG-…`, `("F1a CG-19 …`, `(f"CG-20 …`),
#: and must keep the single-space form. The tuple anchor exists because
#: CG-24's *own* new fixture feeds a synthetic module containing
#: `res.add("WARN", "CG-11 ignore rules", …)` — inside `selftest()`, and
#: therefore credited under the region rule alone. The check reproduced its
#: own defect on the first run after the repair, which is what fixtures are
#: for.
