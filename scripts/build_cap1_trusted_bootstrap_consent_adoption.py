"""Check and apply the CAP1 trusted-bootstrap consent amendment's adoption (P-109).

The candidate `openspec/changes/cap1-trusted-bootstrap-consent/` fully
replaces CAP1-REQ-011 and CAP1-REQ-046 of the adopted Capability 1
specification. The predecessor's bytes are act-bound and are never edited:
the adopted amendment is an overlay, and the effective specification is the
composition its `GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.json` declares (the predecessor with
exactly those two requirement blocks replaced).

    --check      verify the package (pre-apply) or the applied overlay
    --apply      write the adoption overlay (the sign-off change only)
    --selftest   one rule-6 mutant per predicate, in scratch trees

Predicates, each mutated by the selftest:

- **subject**: every file the round-4 review subject
  (`docs/evidence/cap1-trusted-bootstrap-consent-2026-10-15/review-4-subject.json`)
  lists hashes as recorded, and the change directory holds exactly those
  files (plus `ADOPTION.md` once applied; `README.md` is then the adopted
  banner, compared byte for byte with its rendering);
- **baseline**: every protected predecessor in `BASELINE.json` hashes as
  recorded, so no act-bound byte moved;
- **composition**: the dependency record's source files hash as recorded,
  the composed specification hashes to `composed_spec_sha256`, it parses
  through `build_capability_1_spec_dependencies.parse()` to
  `requirement_count` requirements, and its warrant union per class equals
  the record's `dependencies`;
- **anchors**: each predecessor coverage surface the adoption supersedes
  (round-4 finding 1) is found by its literal in the bound
  `CONTRACT-COVERAGE.md`, exactly once;
- **figures**: the predecessor's RFC3 and total mapped counts equal the
  bound union, and the composed figures are computed from the composed
  union, never transcribed; the literal expectations 38 and 40 (round-4 raw,
  finding 1) are an independent oracle;
- **applied**: after `--apply`, `ADOPTION.md` and `README.md` equal their
  regeneration from the tree.

## What is adopted

Version 1.0 of this change, the bytes the round-4 review read
(`{REVIEW.as_posix()}`, `CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`, notes only; subject
`{SUBJECT.as_posix()}`). It fully replaces **CAP1-REQ-011** and
**CAP1-REQ-046**. Every other Capability 1 requirement stays as adopted.

**The effective Capability 1 specification** is the composition
`GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.json` declares: the bound predecessor
`{PRED_SPEC.as_posix()}` with exactly the CAP1-REQ-011 and CAP1-REQ-046
blocks replaced by this change's `specs/…/spec.md`. [Observed, computed by
the builder] It has {f["requirements"]} requirements and {f["scenarios_after"]} scenarios (the bound
file alone has {f["scenarios_before"]}), and its generated warrant union is
`GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.json`. [Observed] `scripts/check_spec_reconciliation.py`
still counts the bound file alone for CAP1; composing this overlay there is
bead `syzygy-5oqc`.

## Predecessor surfaces this adoption supersedes

CC-REV-2 forbids leaving an invalidated authoritative artifact asserting
the old truth. The predecessor's `CONTRACT-COVERAGE.md` and its generated
`GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.md` are act-bound and may not be edited, so this
overlay supersedes the following statements in place. Each is read as
written below for the effective composition; the bound bytes stay as
history. The set is the one round-4 finding 1 names
(`{DISPOSITION.as_posix()}`, note 1).

[Observed, computed by the builder] The composed contract union has
{f["after"]} identifiers; the bound union has {f["before"]}. The difference is exactly {added}.

In `{PRED_COVERAGE.as_posix()}`:

| Surface | Where | Superseded by |
|---|---|---|
| RFC3-16(a) row, valid/invalid act states, **Unknown** | {at("RFC3-16(a) row")} | The consent consequences map to the amended CAP1-REQ-011/046 in this change's `CONTRACT-COVERAGE.md`; the general non-consent owner-act admission consequence stays **Unknown** (its last row). |
| Family table, RFC3 row `38 \\| 11 \\| 27` | {at("family table RFC3 row")} | RFC3: 38 accepted, **{f["rfc3_after"]} mapped, {rfc3_unmapped_after} not mapped**. |
| Family table total `324 \\| 38 \\| 286` | {at("family table total")} | **324 accepted, {f["after"]} mapped, {unmapped_after} not mapped**. |
| "The 38 mapped clauses are exactly the `contracts[]` union in the generated `GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.md`" | {at("mapped sentence")} | The {f["after"]} mapped clauses are exactly the `contracts` union in this change's generated `GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.json`. |
| "The 286 unmapped clauses are disposed in Part B." | {at("unmapped sentence")} | {unmapped_after} unmapped clauses; {added} leave Part B. |
| Part A totals, "65 consequence rows over 38 clauses — 63 covered, 2 Unknown" | {at("Part A totals")} | Part A is the bound table without the RFC3-16(a) row above, plus this change's {n_rows} overlay rows ({classes["covered"]} whose disposition opens "covered", {classes["Unknown"]} "Unknown", {classes["other"]} in other words, each as written there). The composed covered/Unknown totals are not restated here: [Unknown] the {classes["other"]} other-worded row(s) are not classified by this builder. |
| Part B applicability sentence, "the 286 unmapped clauses" | {at("Part B applicability sentence")} | {unmapped_after} unmapped clauses. |
| Part B "RFC 0003 remainder \\| 27" | {at("Part B RFC3 line")} | RFC 0003 remainder: {rfc3_unmapped_after}. |
| Part B total 286 | {at("Part B total")} | {unmapped_after}. |
| Self-check: "`contracts[]` union (38 identifiers), and 38 + 286 = 324" | {at("self-check")} | The composed union has {f["after"]} identifiers and {f["after"]} + {unmapped_after} = 324; check it with this builder's `--check`. `build_capability_1_spec_dependencies.py --check` still checks the bound file against the bound spec, which remains true of those bytes. |

In `{PRED_DEPS.as_posix()}` (generated, bound): it is the union of the bound
specification, not of the effective composition. The effective union is
`GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.json` here.

## Known gap carried with v1.0

Round-4 note 2 (`{DISPOSITION.as_posix()}`): CAP1-REQ-046's refusal
disclosure is a disjunction that does not on its own require the refused
artifact's identity and digest, and RFC3-16(a)'s "blocking is not deletion"
consequence has no overlay row. The owner adopted v1.0 as reviewed; closing
it needs a v1.1 with its own review round (bead `syzygy-0v4l`).

## What this does not do

It edits no act-bound byte, grants no consent for any repository, reads no
target repository and authorizes nothing. Implementation is authorized
separately and bounded by `{IMPLEMENTATION.as_posix()}`; the route is
`{DIRECTION.as_posix()}`.
