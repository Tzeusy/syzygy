"""Record the owner's sign-off of the Three-Surface POC readability successor.

The owner signs off by writing exactly

    SIGN OFF THREE-SURFACE POC READABILITY SUCCESSOR: <sha256>

where the argument is the sha256 of the package manifest
`THREE-SURFACE-POC-READABILITY-SUCCESSOR-MANIFEST.txt`. Its six rows name the
proposed digest of each signed POC subject: four restyled, two unchanged.

The recorder is pinned to the reviewed package:

- `FROZEN_MANIFEST_SHA`: the manifest digest the binding review re-derived;
- `REVIEW` / `REVIEW_SHA`: that review's retained raw, by path and sha256.
  The raw must carry exactly one `Verdict:` line, `CONFIRM` or
  `CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`, and exactly one `Manifest-file SHA-256:` line
  naming the pinned digest.

`--record --phrase "<owner phrase verbatim>"` refuses unless the phrase is the
exact `LABEL: <sha256>` form over the pinned digest, the raw matches its pin,
the package builder verifies, and every signed subject still holds its
effective predecessor bytes. It then writes, in order:

1. the dedicated record `decisions/THREE-SURFACE-POC-READABILITY-SUCCESSOR-ACT.md`;
2. one marked section in `decisions/ACCEPTANCE-ACT-RECORD.md`, the dedicated
   record's bytes;
3. the four restyled subjects, from the builder's proposed bytes.

`--check` reports one of two states and exits 0: `candidate-unperformed`
(no record; every subject at its predecessor bytes) or `performed-exact`
(both records exact; every subject at its manifest row). Anything in between
fails: a partial record, installed bytes without a record, or drift.

Owner: Tzeusy

Act instant: {instant}

Project identity: project:syzygy

Artifact identity: specification:syzygy:three-surface-poc-experience:readability-successor

Act type: sign off specification successor (successor to THREE-SURFACE-POC-SPEC-SIGNOFF-ACT.md and to the coverage row of the general trusted-bootstrap transaction)

Provenance: owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)

A1 audit-record identity: explicitly absent

The owner performed the act by writing exactly:

```text
{LABEL}: {sha}
```

The argument is the sha256 of {MANIFEST}. It was recomputed at recording,
matched the phrase, and equals the reviewed digest the recorder pins.

Confirming review: {pins.review} (sha256 {pins.review_sha})

Signed subjects, predecessor and successor digests:

| Subject | Predecessor | Successor |
|---|---|---|
{table}

Scope: readability restyle of the six-file Three-Surface POC specification.
The 24 POC-REQ identities, their requirement words, scenarios and warrants
are unchanged; the package builder verifies them.

Supersession relationship: each subject is bound by its successor digest
above. The earlier sign-off act and its digests are preserved as act-time
history.

Revocation relationship: none. This act widens no implementation direction
and grants no source, provider, write, deployment or release permission.

This is bootstrap owner provenance, not independent authorship verification,
runtime evidence or product readiness.
