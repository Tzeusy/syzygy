"""Build and verify the Polaris dossier local-agent mode candidate (PR #353).

The candidate holds its four ADDED requirements in
``openspec/changes/polaris-dossier-local-agent-mode/proposed/polaris-generation/spec.md``,
not ``specs/``, because a file under ``specs/`` joins the Polaris effective
composition that ``scripts/count_polaris_effective_scenarios.py`` recounts.
Placing it there is the install step of the owner's version-tagged sign-off
(``tasks.md``, "After sign-off"), and this module is the builder
``scripts/record_versioned_signoff.py`` runs for it. No digest argument
exists: the sign-off binds the tag ``polaris-dossier-local-agent-mode-v1.0``.

``--check`` verifies the package in either state and writes nothing:

- unapplied: the spec is in ``proposed/`` only; it carries exactly one
  ``## ADDED Requirements`` section naming the four requirements below; a
  scratch copy of the composition with it installed composes under both of
  the recount tool's parsers; the status page's figure equals the recount of
  the tree as it stands; and each package file that cites the proposed path
  in full still does (the install rewrites exactly those citations);
- applied: the spec is in ``specs/`` only, with the same shape; the status
  page's figure equals the recount, which composes the four requirements;
  its "without" figure equals the recount of the composition without the
  installed spec; and no package file cites the proposed path in full.

The CLI writes nothing. The sign-off recorder
(``record_versioned_signoff.py --record``) is the one writer: it verifies
the reviewed bytes, calls ``apply()``, and writes the sign-off record the
status sentence links to. An install without that record would leave a
tree no tool can record (R-364-2 Finding 2), so ``--apply`` is not offered
here. ``apply()`` refuses unless the unapplied package verifies; then
it moves the spec, removes the emptied ``proposed/`` directories, rewrites
the full-path citations, and rewrites the status page's figure as two
figures: the composition without the addition, and the effective
composition with it, naming the installed path and the v1.0 sign-off
record. The review brief keeps the path its reviews read, unquoted and
dated by the sign-off; a short ``proposed/polaris-generation/spec.md``
mention is prose about the move and is left alone. A later install that
changes the composition (the narrative profile's, in
``install_redis_sitting.py``) must rewrite both figures, which
``refigure()`` does. A candidate commit, review or merge performs no owner
act.

Before #353 merges the change directory is absent; ``--check`` then reports
the package not present and passes, unless a sign-off record for it exists.

``--selftest`` runs a mutation fixture per predicate in temporary trees.
