## Population and denominator

`[Observed]` The accepted clause population is the Wave A/B install:
**324 defined clause identifiers across the 30 modules at
`contracts/rfcs/`** (RFC 0001–0009). Counted this session by two
methods that agree exactly per family: (1) a Python `re` sweep over the
30 module files for clause-definition headers; (2) the clause rows of
the generated `05-CONTRACT-INDEX.yaml`, excluding its RFC10/RFC11 rows
(deferred candidates, not accepted, outside this population).

Every clause was judged exactly once and lands in exactly one part:

- **Part A** — clauses at least one of whose consequences a
  requirement's oracle observes (the `contracts[]` union).
- **Part B1** — clauses the author judged applicable to the POC's scope
  but which **no requirement covers**. Every row is Unknown pending
  owner-reviewed N/A. These are the spec's real gaps, surfaced for the
  sign-off decision rather than folded away.
- **Part B2** — clauses the author believes not applicable under
  CC-SPEC-8's test, per-clause, offered to the owner.

| Family | Accepted clauses | Part A (mapped) | Part B1 (applicable, uncovered) | Part B2 (believed not applicable) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RFC1 | 39 | 12 | 4 | 23 |
| RFC2 | 27 | 7 | 0 | 20 |
| RFC3 | 38 | 0 | 0 | 38 |
| RFC4 | 32 | 10 | 1 | 21 |
| RFC5 | 27 | 1 | 15 | 11 |
| RFC6 | 28 | 10 | 1 | 17 |
| RFC7 | 41 | 12 | 4 | 25 |
| RFC8 | 32 | 5 | 0 | 27 |
| RFC9 | 60 | 17 | 2 | 41 |
| **Total** | **324** | **74** | **27** | **223** |

The Part A clause set is exactly the `contracts[]` union in the
generated `GOVERNING-DEPENDENCIES.md` (verified below).

## Part A — mapped clauses, per observable consequence

Disposition vocabulary: **covered** (the named requirements' oracles
observe the consequence) or **Unknown** (a consequence limb of a mapped
clause that no requirement covers and no owner-reviewed N/A settles).

**Row method.** `[Inferred]` One row per normatively distinct
obligation limb the capability touches, judged by the author from the
accepted bytes; folds are disclosed in the disposition notes rather
than hidden. No method demonstrates that every clause's limb set was
exhausted — a reviewer who finds an unlisted limb has found a real gap.

| RFC1-16 | Four capability↔code classes never conflated; no fabricated edge | covered — Direct match | POC-REQ-052 |
| RFC1-19 | No evidence ⇒ Unknown never success; narrative/activity substituting for a badge is judged as a badge | covered — Fold disclosed: Polaris's narrative-gap rule and Trajectory's activity-as-satisfaction rule are the same consequence | POC-REQ-032, POC-REQ-043 |
| RFC1-22 | Execution-plane facts may never satisfy a desired-state claim | covered — Trajectory's work-item activity must not render as satisfaction | POC-REQ-043 |

| RFC2-1 | Observed inputs (repo, Dolt DB) identified by revision/hash, not by description | covered — Only the revision-identification limb of the 11-item list is touched; challenge/evidence/act-record items (4,6,9,11) are unbuilt | POC-REQ-001, POC-REQ-004, POC-REQ-010 |

| RFC2-3 | Time-sensitive rendering computed from recorded instants, never ambient wall-clock | covered — Matches "as-of instant explicit, never ambient wall-clock" near-verbatim | POC-REQ-041 |
| RFC2-6 | Coverage record for an executed mapping/oracle, with reconciling counts | covered — Thin/partial touch — only the coverage-record sub-item of the full immutable observation-record artifact is instanced; no persisted record, claim instances, tiers, evidence links, or challenge sets exist | POC-REQ-042, POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC2-20 | Scheduler closure/merge/activity never rendered as reconciled/satisfied | covered — Near-verbatim match to the closure-fallacy prohibition, applied to Trajectory | POC-REQ-043 |
| RFC2-23 | Observer-failed / source-unreachable → Unknown with named reason, never invisible failure | covered — Two of six degradation states touched; Consent-withdrawn, Excluded-content, Missing-quantity are not (no consent revocation, no partial-content capture, no absent-measure rendering in POC) | POC-REQ-003, POC-REQ-013 |
| RFC2-23 | Partial/failed observation never presented as complete | covered — "never partial-as-complete" is near-verbatim to the Partial-snapshot rendering obligation | POC-REQ-003 |
| RFC2-24 | Unknown claim carries reason #10 `source-uncaptured-or-unreachable` | covered — Inferred reuse of the Cap1 closed reason vocabulary via the shared runtime spine; exact reason string not directly quoted in the digest | POC-REQ-003, POC-REQ-013 |
| RFC2-24 | Reason #5 `mapping-coverage-absent` — absence/Unknown regions justified by a coverage record, never a silent gap | covered — Empty-plot-rule pattern; borderline since digest doesn't name the reason explicitly | POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC4-2 | Output determinism class declared/exhibited (derivation-deterministic) | covered — "structure facts deterministic per revision" is item 5's determinism-class vocabulary | POC-REQ-004 |
| RFC4-2 | Failure states named + mapped to rendering | covered — item 6's failure-state mapping duty | POC-REQ-003, POC-REQ-013 |
| RFC4-2 | Authority boundary: write surface empty unless authorized | **Unknown** — scope bars writes to the observed project, but no enumerated requirement's oracle checks an empty write surface | — |
| RFC4-3 | Emitted structure facts carry capture/revision + relocatable provenance | covered — exact-git-revision binding is the capture/provenance obligation for structure facts | POC-REQ-001 |
| RFC4-3 | Emitted work items carry capture/revision + relocatable provenance | covered — Dolt-revision-stamped provenance is the same obligation applied to work items | POC-REQ-010 |
| RFC4-3 | Capturing observer identity + version stamped on emissions | **Unknown** — no digest requirement enumerates an observer identity/version field | — |
| RFC4-4 | Observer failure renders Unknown-with-reason, never invisible or partial-as-complete | covered — direct match | POC-REQ-003, POC-REQ-013 |
| RFC4-5 | Inward limb: external work-item projection stamped with the revision that read it | covered — Dolt-revision stamping satisfies "stamped with the identified evaluation" | POC-REQ-010 |
| RFC4-5 | Inward limb: that projection never presented as editable, discarded/re-derived rather than merged | **Unknown** — Trajectory's read-only nature is architectural; no digest requirement's oracle tests non-editability | — |
| RFC4-6 | Substrate status vocabulary translated into surface (Trajectory column) vocabulary on read | covered — "declared closed status-vocabulary mapping" is exactly this translation | POC-REQ-040 |
| RFC4-6 | Substrate-native identifiers (bead id / bead-prefix) carried as qualified alias, never primary key | **Unknown** — POC-REQ-011 checks prefix membership but no requirement confirms bead_id isn't used as primary identity elsewhere | — |
| RFC4-11 | Code-structure observation bound to a specific repository-identity → revision map entry | covered — "exact git revision" binding is RFC4-11's revision-map read applied here | POC-REQ-001 |
| RFC4-12 | File inventory restricted to structure/metadata only, never contents; static-parsing-only boundary | covered — "metadata, sizes, languages, hashes — never indexed contents" matches this observer's structure-only boundary; structural-relations/code-element-identity limbs untouched (never reads contents), omitted | POC-REQ-001, POC-REQ-002 |
| RFC4-12 | Observer failure/unreadable path rendering | covered — code-structure-specific instance of the general degrade-to-Unknown duty | POC-REQ-003 |
| RFC4-15 | Work-item identity + status vocabulary faithfully, capture-stamped transmitted as substrate declares (never hardcoded) | covered — direct match | POC-REQ-010 |
| RFC4-15 | Reads only the live/authoritative substrate, never a derived passive export, as a work-item source | covered — export-mutation oracle is exactly this authority-boundary check | POC-REQ-012 |
| RFC4-15 | Degraded mode: substrate unreadable renders Unknown-with-reason, distinct from a genuinely empty result | covered — matches "export unavailable → last-good marked stale," applied as Unknown-vs-empty distinction | POC-REQ-013 |
| RFC4-26 | Capability/entity↔code mappings are declared-only, inferred mappings excluded | covered — Orrery's declared-mappings-only design is exactly class (i) with class (ii) excluded, matching the scope's "no inferred mappings or edges" | POC-REQ-050, POC-REQ-052 |
| RFC4-27 | Unmapped/absence claim requires an executed coverage record with reconciling counts, never silent absence | covered — "unmapped code a visible Unknown region with reconciling counts" is this clause's coverage-record duty applied to Orrery | POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC5-16 | (a) Observation-capture ingest screening for Butlers repo structure | covered — POC-REQ-002's "never indexed contents" sentinel sweep structurally avoids most of the screening concern for code bodies, but doesn't test the secret-detection-policy mechanism itself | POC-REQ-002 (partial) |
| RFC5-16 | (b) Beads/Dolt work-item ingest screening | **Unknown** — POC-REQ-010/013 test provenance and Unknown-on-failure, not secret screening of ingested work-item text | — |
| RFC6-13 | Machine endpoint answers from the same fact set surfaces render; no endpoint-only or UI-only facts | covered — POC's `/api/poc` + client/no-script parity is exactly SDR-27's bidirectional obligation this clause states | POC-REQ-020, POC-REQ-022 |
| RFC6-14 | Machine answer never silently omits or folds Unknown/epistemic state into a total | covered — Fold: full RFC2-25 tier / secondary-annotation / sibling-surface-state / challenge-pending limbs dropped — POC carries no such vocabulary | POC-REQ-020, POC-REQ-042, POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC6-15 | Every answer names the revision/evaluation it was computed at; same input ⇒ same answer | covered — "Filters" limb not present (no query filter surface in POC-REQ list) — folded to revision-stamping + determinism only | POC-REQ-001, POC-REQ-004, POC-REQ-010 |
| RFC6-16 | An answer declares its scope and never presents a filtered/partial result as full coverage | covered — Bead-prefix scoping (011) and Trajectory's selection-rule/reconciling-counts disclosure (042) are declared-scope instances | POC-REQ-011, POC-REQ-042 |
| RFC6-17 | An aggregate discloses its membership count/composition rather than a bare total | covered — Fold: only basic count-disclosure limb; full RFC6-22-tuple composition (tier/sibling/challenge/chain-state counts) not built | POC-REQ-042, POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC6-18 | Two surfaces must not differ in which facts/labels exist for one underlying selection — divergence is a model defect, not UI variance | covered — Fold: the dedicated "evidence drawer" container / "Why this answer?" naming is not built; only the general non-divergence principle applies | POC-REQ-020, POC-REQ-060 |
| RFC6-19 | Evidence content travels as resolvable links carrying source/provenance | covered — Fold to class 3/4 (evidence+provenance) only; classes 1,2,5,6,7,8 (lifecycle, warrant, challenge, policy/consent, work-state) explicitly Unknown/out of scope this slice | POC-REQ-031 |
| RFC6-20 | Every internal link in the rendered fact set resolves to its identified target; kernel/model never emits an unresolvable reference | covered — Trust-floor (VIS-7) limb applies independent of the drawer wrapper; Polaris citations and Orrery→table routes are the POC's instances | POC-REQ-031, POC-REQ-053 |
| RFC6-22 | Two renderings are equivalent only if they share evaluation identity, declared filters, graph, and epistemic states for every presented element | covered — Fold: sibling-surface-state, challenge-pending, chain-state, normalized-work-state, and scenario-context limbs excluded — none exist in POC | POC-REQ-020, POC-REQ-041, POC-REQ-042, POC-REQ-060 |
| RFC6-23 | No two renderings may disagree on an entity's existence, a count, or a freshness state over one declared scope; finer detail must be disclosed, not silent | covered — Marker-sweep and reconciling-count oracles are direct instances of this no-disagreement rule | POC-REQ-020, POC-REQ-041, POC-REQ-042, POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC7-2 | Every load-bearing claim anchored to its owning artifact | covered — limb (a) | POC-REQ-031 |
| RFC7-2 | Framing/motivational prose marked non-normative | **Unknown** — limb (b); no POC-REQ distinguishes non-factual framing prose | — |
| RFC7-2 | Gaps rendered as epistemically labeled, never asserted | covered — limb (c) | POC-REQ-032 |
| RFC7-5 | Narrative/Section/Claim-block/citation-graph entity model | covered — entity-model limb only; `.syzygy/intent/**` residence, presentation-profile bootstrap, editorial-draft and curated-diagram entities not built (fold disclosed) | POC-REQ-030, POC-REQ-031 |
| RFC7-6 | One primary narrative renders, never absent | covered | POC-REQ-030 |

| RFC7-9 | Anchor set covers each claim; reader can tell which anchor supports it | covered — limb (a) | POC-REQ-030, POC-REQ-031 |
| RFC7-9 | No surplus/unused anchors in a block | **Unknown** — limb (b) | — |
| RFC7-9 | Blocks bounded so claim-to-anchor attribution stays recoverable | **Unknown** — limb (c) | — |
| RFC7-10 | Anchors are typed, durable identifiers, never labels/paths | covered | POC-REQ-031 |
| RFC7-10 | Target-state recorded at authorship, never rewritten on later read | **Unknown** — fixed-single-revision model gives no re-read/drift window | — |
| RFC7-11 | Broken/unresolvable anchor renders Unknown with reason, never silently dropped or auto-redirected | covered — failure-side view of the same "zero dangling citations" invariant | POC-REQ-031 |
| RFC7-13 | Progressive multi-page disclosure, each page an honest self-sufficient read | covered | POC-REQ-030, POC-REQ-032 |
| RFC7-13 | Every narrative descends to a verbatim leaf | **Unknown** — tension with POC-REQ-002's content exclusion; V0 altitude vocabulary (thesis/manifesto/etc.) not built | — |
| RFC7-18 | Reality-band facts come from the one shared model, never a second Polaris-side computation | covered | POC-REQ-020 |
| RFC7-19 | Empty content collapses to one honest line, never a blank/scaffold section | covered | POC-REQ-032 |
| RFC7-29 | Narrative/claim blocks/citation graph are Polaris's own composition; every other fact class stays authoritative elsewhere | covered | POC-REQ-031, POC-REQ-032 |
| RFC7-33 | Every rendered distinction served identically machine vs human | covered | POC-REQ-020, POC-REQ-022 |
| RFC7-33 | `non-citable`/`presentation-artifact` attribute carried on every rendering | **Unknown** | — |

| RFC7-34 | Every distinction recoverable without colour/position/layout; legended encodings | covered | POC-REQ-061 |
| RFC7-34 | Disclosure paths operable without a pointing device | covered | POC-REQ-061, POC-REQ-022 |
| RFC8-2 | Beads closure/activity never rendered as done/green/complete | covered — Anti-thesis limb (b) matches directly; limb (a) [no editable store — POC never writes] and limb (c) [fleet-change/cost/authority accounting] aren't touched by POC scope, so only (b) rows here | POC-REQ-043 |
| RFC8-12 | Kanban state field renders only a declared, closed set of status values — no minted/free-form values | covered — POC's "declared closed status-vocabulary mapping" exercises the closed-vocabulary/no-minting invariant; the specific 13-value partition, chain-state field separation, and `reconciled` carve-out aren't adopted since Trajectory renders no reconciliation chain state | POC-REQ-040 |
| RFC8-15 | Closure without a merge/verification fact never rendered as a normalized "done"/complete/finished/resolved label | covered — Matches the terminal-state closure-fallacy rule (`closed-unmerged` analog) this clause states directly | POC-REQ-043 |
| RFC8-30 | No aggregate, badge, progress bar, or prose sentence renders closed work as done/complete/satisfied absent verification evidence | covered — Same closure-fallacy prohibition restated at module-3 level; disclosed fold — RFC8-2(b), RFC8-15, and RFC8-30 all map to the same one POC requirement from three angles | POC-REQ-043 |
| RFC8-31 | Every rendered state/cause/absence value recoverable by text alone (no colour/position-only encoding); every traversal keyboard-operable | covered — Non-visual-parity limb matches the design-token/epistemic-encoding and accessibility-floor requirements directly; the RFC 0006 selection/drawer/scenario-context conformance bundle this clause also invokes is not touched (no drawer/selection UX in the POC-REQ list), so that limb is omitted rather than rowed | POC-REQ-060, POC-REQ-061 |
| RFC9-1 | Map surface is a non-authoritative projection of the shared fact model | covered — POC's Orrery projects the same shared fact model that parity (020) enforces; intended/proposed/historical planes and RFC2/RFC6 vocabulary limbs not touched | POC-REQ-020 |
| RFC9-3 | Every rendered encoding traceable to an identified/declared artifact, reachable from the element | covered — No relationship/encoding beyond declared mappings; the surface-local "shared drawer" mechanism itself isn't built | POC-REQ-050, POC-REQ-052, POC-REQ-053 |
| RFC9-4 | Position bound to declared structure, never to a measurement | covered — POC's directory/declared-mapping hierarchy substitutes for the capability-district hierarchy but the anchoring principle is used | POC-REQ-050 |
| RFC9-5 | Declared mappings anchor position | covered — Positive anchoring limb | POC-REQ-050 |
| RFC9-5 | Inferred mappings never anchor geography | **Unknown** — POC scope excludes inferred mappings/edges outright, but no requirement exercises the prohibition (structural absence, never tested) | — |
| RFC9-5 | File paths are attributes, never identity; confined to unmapped district | covered — Matches unmapped-district treatment | POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC9-7 | Code mapping to no declared entity renders Unknown, never silently inferred, and lives in the unmapped district | covered — Direct match | POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC9-9 | Declared containment expressed positionally (nesting = declared membership) | covered — Directory nesting is POC's containment reading; declared-relatedness (edges) not built — POC has no declared-dependency concept | POC-REQ-050 |
| RFC9-14 | The projection is a deterministic function of declared facts at the observed revision | covered — Baseline/version-tuple incremental-regeneration machinery not built; POC recomputes fresh per revision | POC-REQ-004, POC-REQ-050 |
| RFC9-17 | Position changes only for a declared reason; an unchanged snapshot/preserving refactor must not move anything | covered — Reservation-policy/footprint-band limb not applicable — no lens bands in POC | POC-REQ-004, POC-REQ-050 |
| RFC9-24 | Unknown is a reserved, mandatory, distinct treatment — never silently omitted or shown as a positive state | covered — The richer sibling-state palette (Contradicted/Dismissed/Proposed/Unadopted/Editorial-draft) has no POC analog | POC-REQ-003, POC-REQ-013, POC-REQ-022, POC-REQ-032, POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC9-27 | Unknown never renders as zero, absent, or a positive/green reading | covered — Direct match, per-element and per-region | POC-REQ-003, POC-REQ-013, POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC9-27 | An aggregated/regional view carries its Unknown contribution rather than presenting only known members | covered — Aggregate-scale form of the same rule | POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC9-29 | Text/labels state only what identified artifacts state; an Unknown entity carries an explicit label, never omitted | covered — Secret-exclusion granularity-bound limb is moot — POC never indexes content at all (POC-REQ-002) | POC-REQ-003, POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC9-38 | The rendered scene is bound to and identifies the exact evaluation (git revision) it reflects, not an ambient state | covered — Single fixed-revision observation only; non-default-snapshot marker and time-travel-between-evaluations limbs not built | POC-REQ-001 |
| RFC9-42 | An Unknown/unresolved region renders as an aggregate in a reserved treatment, never fabricated detail | covered — Zoom/LOD-specific mechanics aren't established in the digest; the non-fabrication principle for unknown regions is | POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC9-43 | An aggregate discloses its membership count and reconciles to a known total, rather than silently absorbing unknowns | covered — Richer per-tier/freshness/chain-state composition disclosure has no POC analog (no tiers/freshness/chain-state vocabulary in POC) | POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC9-44 | Unmapped/undeclared code is aggregated and visible by default, with count and reasons, and never disappears | covered — Direct match; the adapter-minted stable-identity/selection-reference-survival limb (RFC1-5/RFC6-1/RFC6-9) not applicable — no drawer or persistent selection refs in POC | POC-REQ-051 |
| RFC9-46 | The spatial (Orrery) view and a non-spatial/tabular or machine view present equivalent facts for the same scope | covered — Declared-dependency positional-expression-state / backlog-partition-count additions not applicable — no such edges in POC | POC-REQ-020, POC-REQ-053 |
| RFC9-48 | Full keyboard navigation, textual epistemic labels, reduced motion honored, text contrast maintained | covered — Direct match | POC-REQ-061 |
| RFC9-48 | A tabular/non-3D equivalent serves as the screen-reader-accessible surface | covered — Every Orrery entity links to its exact-table route; parity keeps that route truthful | POC-REQ-053, POC-REQ-020 |

Part A totals `[Observed, computed by the sweep in "Verifying this
table"]`: **107 consequence rows over 74 clauses — 92 covered,
15 Unknown.**

## Part B1 — applicable clauses no requirement covers

`[Inferred]` The author judges these clauses applicable — the POC uses
what they govern — yet **no requirement's oracle observes any of their
consequences**. Every row renders **Unknown pending owner-reviewed
N/A**. The largest block is RFC5: the POC reuses Capability 1's
authenticated runtime spine, so authentication, exposure-mode, secret
screening for work-item text, and audit-record obligations are in play
without POC-specific requirements. The sign-off decision should either
accept these as disclosed Unknowns for a bounded non-release POC, or
direct requirement additions.

| Clause | Observable consequence (row label) | Disposition | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| RFC1-3 | Observed-source repository is read-only; no writes emitted to Butlers | **Unknown** — Borderline: out-of-scope bars "writes to the observed project," matching RFC1-3's read-only default, but no POC-REQ's oracle tests absence of writes; consent-record specifics have no matching requirement | — |
| RFC1-6 | VCS objects (git revision) not reified as first-class nodes, enter only as identifier/evidence | **Unknown** — POC stamps facts with "exact git revision"; no requirement's oracle checks it isn't reified as a separate Commit node | — |
| RFC1-17 | Multi-capability code-element mapping counted identity-based, once per query subject | **Unknown** — Orrery's reconciling-counts req (051) doesn't explicitly test non-duplication under multi-capability mapping | — |
| RFC1-33 | No implementation work for RFC1's observable consequences may be scheduled without an approved OpenSpec requirement/scenario mapping or reviewed N/A | **Unknown** — Discharge is structural (this requirement set + the coverage matrix), not tested by any single POC-REQ's runtime oracle | — |
| RFC4-1 | Each external authority (git repo, Beads Dolt DB) reached through exactly one mediating reader | **Unknown** — POC's single shared fact-model design ("do not split surface truth stores") implies single-path mediation, but no digest requirement's oracle tests it | — |
| RFC5-1 | Every authenticated act (GET /api/poc, human page) binds to exactly one principal | **Unknown** — Scope's Context names an authenticated machine endpoint + human surfaces; no POC-REQ tests principal binding | — |
| RFC5-2 | Session (browser) and machine credential (GET /api/poc) stay distinct, non-transferable | **Unknown** — POC serves both client classes per Context; no POC-REQ addresses this | — |
| RFC5-3 | Requests classified machine-vs-browser by credential, not location, across both POC channels | **Unknown** — Underlies the human/machine parity requirement (020) but 020 tests content equality, not classification | — |
| RFC5-4 | (a) session requirement / session-identity-only / declared lifetime + revocation | **Unknown** — Reused Cap1 browser-surface discipline; folded 3 sub-bullets into one row, disclosed | — |

| RFC5-8 | POC mounts routes under tailnet exposure mode (per recent commits) and origin-checks against it | **Unknown** — Directly used — POC added tailnet-serve-prefix mounting and tailnet-host origin allowance; no POC-REQ covers exposure-mode discipline | — |

Part B1 totals `[Observed, computed]`: **28 consequence rows over
27 clauses — all Unknown.**

## Part B2 — clauses believed not applicable (author's reading, non-binding)

`[Inferred]` The author applied CC-SPEC-8's applicability test — *does
the POC use the entity, behavior, authority boundary, state vocabulary,
or interface the clause governs?* — and believes each clause below
governs machinery the POC neither renders, stores, transitions,
queries, nor crosses. **A belief is not a reviewed N/A**; until the
owner records N/A judgments in `decisions/`, these clauses' consequences
also render Unknown pending owner-reviewed N/A. The per-clause readings
are listed so the owner can review or contest each one directly.

| Clause | Chiefly governs (author's reading, non-binding) |
|---|---|
| RFC1-1 | Project entity's single-governance-root invariant and zero/two-root handling; POC has one fixed configured repo, no Project/governance-root declaration modeled |

| RFC2-8 | Inference-overlay authority ceiling and conservative suspension via challenge; no overlays or challenges exist in POC |
| RFC2-9 | Currency-bound declaration mechanism gating evidence staleness; POC judges no evidence currency (test-evidence relationship stays Unknown) |
| RFC2-10 | Closed fresh/stale/broken/superseded freshness vocabulary across multiple evaluations; POC is one-shot with no persisted supersession history |

| RFC2-22 | Fixed-point idempotence across repeated evaluations of an unchanged no-gap snapshot; POC is one-shot, not a repeated-evaluation loop |
| RFC2-25 | Six-tier claim-rendering registry plus sibling surface states (dismissed/unadopted-draft/editorial-draft); POC's direct fact-vs-Unknown rendering uses none of this vocabulary |

| RFC4-30 | The OpenSpec implementation-scheduling authority boundary for the RFC4 package itself — a process rule on how Syzygy schedules implementation work, not a runtime behavior/state the POC capability renders |

| RFC6-25 | Context traveling with selection across surfaces/URLs/queries; depends on RFC6-24's construct, absent here |

| RFC6-27 | SEC-5 secret-detection exclusion rendered with a count; POC's "never indexed contents" is a non-collection design choice, not a detect-and-exclude policy |

| RFC8-6 | Compaction-record schema and retention-fact discipline; POC performs no compaction |

| RFC8-32 | The RFC→OpenSpec phase-boundary/coverage-matrix authoring obligation; a process rule governing this sweep itself, not a capability-rendered entity or behavior |
| RFC9-2 | This RFC's own semantics-vs-rendering-technology scope boundary — a self-referential meta-rule, not an entity/behavior POC renders |

| RFC9-30 | Inferred-contribution rendering, challenge-suspension, consent-gated inference degradation; POC never computes inferred data |
| RFC9-31 | The lens contract (channel binding, one-active-lens rule); POC has no lenses |
| RFC9-32 | V0 lens/overlay set (Architecture, Verification, work/construction, freshness); lens-specific, not built |
| RFC9-33 | Post-V0 lens roadmap (Change/churn, Risk, Runtime); lens-specific |

Part B2 total `[Observed, computed]`: **223 clauses.**

## Verifying this table

- Denominator: re-run the two counting methods named above; both must
  return 324 for RFC1–9, and 74 + 27 + 223 = 324.
- Mapped set: `python3 scripts/build_three_surface_poc_spec_dependencies.py
  --check` — Part A's clause column must equal the generated
  `contracts[]` union (74 identifiers).
- Totals: count rows and dispositions in this file's tables (e.g.
  Python over the `| RFC` rows); the printed totals must match the
  count — they were computed that way, not transcribed.
