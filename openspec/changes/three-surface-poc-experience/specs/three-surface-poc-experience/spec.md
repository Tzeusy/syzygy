# Specification — three-surface-poc-experience

> **Candidate.** Binds nothing until owner sign-off
> (`.syzygy/governance/decisions/THREE-SURFACE-POC-SPEC-AUTHORIZATION.md`).

## Purpose

Lets a person and a machine read one observed external project through
three honest, visually distinct surface experiences — Polaris as a
long-form white-paper, Trajectory as a work-item board with time
visualization over the project's Beads Dolt database, Orrery as a
deterministic spatial code map — all consuming one shared fact model,
with every Unknown visible with its reason and every positive claim
carrying resolvable provenance.

## ADDED Requirements

Reader notes, binding on how this file is read:

- **Subject.** "The POC" names the Three-Surface POC application and
  core packages under specification. "The shared model" is the one
  in-memory fact model both `GET /api/poc` and every human surface
  consume. "The configured project" is the single Butlers repository
  the 2026-08-29 direction bounds the POC to. A "human surface" is any
  rendering a person reads (server- or client-rendered); the "machine
  answer" is the authenticated `GET /api/poc` response. Both are
  observation points for every oracle below.
- **Groups.** Requirements are organized into seven literal groups,
  named in each requirement's `Group` line: *Code-structure
  observation* (001–004), *Work-item observation* (010–013), *Client
  rendering and parity* (020–022), *Polaris* (030–032), *Trajectory*
  (040–043), *Orrery* (050–053), *Cross-cutting experience* (060–061).
  Identifiers are stable and literal: minted once, amended in place,
  retired rather than reused, never renumbered (CC-SPEC-3). Gaps in the
  numbering are deliberate.
- **Warrants.** Each requirement ends with a machine-readable
  `warrants` block in CC-SPEC-2's six classes. `decisions` entries cite
  recorded owner directions by their record file in
  `.syzygy/governance/decisions/`: `POC-DIR-2026-08-29` names
  `THREE-SURFACE-POC-MODE-DIRECTION.md` and `POC-DIR-2026-08-30` names
  `THREE-SURFACE-POC-REDESIGN-DIRECTION.md`. `contracts[]` entries come
  from the CC-SPEC-8 sweep recorded in this change's
  `CONTRACT-COVERAGE.md`: a clause is listed exactly where the sweep
  found the requirement's oracle observes one of that clause's
  consequences. POC-REQ-021's empty `contracts[]` is a sweep result
  (no accepted clause maps to it; it rests on doctrine and decisions),
  not an authoring gap.
- **Vocabulary.** No verifying evidence → `Unknown`, never success
  (VIS-2); every Unknown rendered by a surface carries its reason. An
  "identified observation" is the pair (source revision, capture
  instant). The "registered bead-prefix" is the issue-identifier prefix
  the configured project's Beads database is registered under (for
  Butlers: `bu`).
- **Determinism.** Where a requirement says "deterministic", it means:
  two runs over identical source revisions and identical declared
  inputs produce identical fact content and identical layout
  assignments, with only display formatting and serving timestamps
  excluded.

### Requirement: POC-REQ-001 — Code-structure observation is bound to an exact revision

Group: Code-structure observation. Form: **event-response**.

WHEN the POC observes the configured project's code structure, it SHALL
produce one identified observation naming the exact git revision
observed, containing a directory and file inventory (paths, sizes,
per-file content digests, and declared language classifications) whose
every entry carries that revision as provenance.

- **Case**: a checker runs the POC against the configured repository at
  a known commit.
- **Observable**: the observation's revision and inventory appear in
  the machine answer; Orrery renders from it (POC-REQ-050).
- **Oracle**: compare the served revision against `git rev-parse HEAD`
  of the observed checkout, and a sampled file's served size and digest
  against `stat` and an independent digest of the same path at that
  commit; equality decides. Bounded: one revision, sampled entries.
- **Oracle independence**: expected values come from git and the
  filesystem directly, never from the POC's own output.
- **Falsifier**: a served inventory entry whose revision, size, or
  digest differs from the repository's own state at the named commit,
  or an observation served without a revision.

#### Scenario: Structure observed at a commit

- **WHEN** the POC observes the configured project checked out at
  commit R
- **THEN** the machine answer serves one code-structure observation
  identified by R, and every inventory entry cites R as its provenance
  revision

### Requirement: POC-REQ-002 — Structure observation captures metadata, never indexed contents

Group: Code-structure observation. Form: **prohibition**.

The POC SHALL NOT index, store, or serve observed file contents from
the code-structure observation. Scope of quantification: every field of
every served code-structure fact. Only paths, sizes, counts, language
classifications, digests, revisions, and capture instants may appear.

- **Case (counterexample schema + sweep)**: a checker plants a file
  containing a unique sentinel string in the observed repository,
  triggers observation, then sweeps the entire machine answer and every
  human surface for the sentinel. The denominator is the full byte
  content of both channels.
- **Observable**: the sentinel appears nowhere in either channel.
- **Oracle**: substring search for the sentinel over the complete
  served bytes; absence over the exhausted population decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the sentinel is authored by the checker,
  unknown to the implementation.
- **Falsifier**: the sentinel — or any observed file's body text —
  appearing in any served output.

#### Scenario: Planted content never served

- **WHEN** an observed file contains a checker-authored sentinel and
  observation runs
- **THEN** no served human or machine output contains the sentinel;
  the file appears only as path, size, digest, and classification

### Requirement: POC-REQ-003 — Failed structure observation renders Unknown with its reason

Group: Code-structure observation. Form: **event-response**.

WHEN the code-structure observation cannot be produced (repository
unreadable, revision unresolvable, observer failure), the POC SHALL
serve the code-structure region as Unknown carrying a named reason, and
SHALL NOT serve a partial inventory as if complete.

- **Case**: a checker points the POC at an unreadable or absent
  repository path and requests both channels.
- **Observable**: both channels serve Unknown with a reason for the
  code-structure region; Orrery renders its Unknown state
  (POC-REQ-051), never an empty-but-green map.
- **Oracle**: the served epistemic label equals `Unknown` and the
  reason field is non-empty and names the failure class; string
  comparison decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the checker induced the failure and knows
  its class independently of the POC's report.
- **Falsifier**: a green or populated structure rendering, a
  reason-less Unknown, or a partial inventory served without
  distinguishing itself from a complete one.

#### Scenario: Unreadable repository

- **WHEN** the configured repository path is unreadable at observation
  time
- **THEN** the code-structure region is served Unknown with a named
  reason on both channels

```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-004 — Structure facts are deterministic per revision

Group: Code-structure observation. Form: **invariant**.

For any revision R of the configured project, two code-structure
observations of R SHALL produce identical fact content. Scope of
quantification: all served code-structure facts across repeated runs at
the same revision.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker runs observation twice at the same
  commit, holding declared inputs fixed, and diffs the two machine
  answers' code-structure regions in full — the denominator is every
  field of both.
- **Observable**: the two fact sets are byte-identical outside
  capture-instant fields.
- **Oracle**: structural diff excluding declared capture-instant
  fields; emptiness decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the diff tool is generic, not POC code.
- **Falsifier**: any fact field differing between the two runs.

#### Scenario: Repeated observation at one commit

- **WHEN** observation runs twice at commit R with identical inputs
- **THEN** the served code-structure facts are identical apart from
  capture instants

```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-010 — Work items are read from the Dolt database and revision-stamped

Group: Work-item observation. Form: **event-response**.

WHEN the POC observes the configured project's work items, it SHALL
read them from the project's Beads database hosted on Dolt, and SHALL
serve the observation identified by the exact Dolt revision read, with
every served work-item fact carrying that revision as provenance.

- **Case**: a checker runs work-item observation against the configured
  Beads Dolt database at a known Dolt head.
- **Observable**: the machine answer names the Dolt revision; a sampled
  item's served status and timestamps match the database.
- **Oracle**: compare the served Dolt revision against the database's
  own head revision queried directly, and a sampled item's fields
  against a direct SQL read at that revision; equality decides.
- **Oracle independence**: expected values come from querying Dolt
  directly, never from the POC's output.
- **Falsifier**: a served work-item observation with no Dolt revision,
  or a sampled field differing from the database's value at the named
  revision.

#### Scenario: Items read at a Dolt head

- **WHEN** work-item observation runs while the Beads Dolt database is
  at revision D
- **THEN** the served observation is identified by D and sampled item
  facts equal direct reads at D

```yaml
warrants:
  primary: VIS-6
  doctrine: [VIS-2, VIS-6, VIS-7]
  contracts: [RFC1-5, RFC1-9, RFC2-1, RFC4-3, RFC4-5, RFC4-15, RFC6-15]

  decisions: [POC-DIR-2026-08-30]
  topology: []
  parent_requirements: []
```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-011 — Work-item observation is scoped to the registered bead-prefix

Group: Work-item observation. Form: **invariant**.

Every served work item SHALL carry an identifier under the configured
project's registered bead-prefix. Scope of quantification: all work
items in the machine answer and on every human surface.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker enumerates every served work-item
  identifier from the machine answer — the denominator is the complete
  served item set — and checks each against the registered prefix.
- **Observable**: every identifier matches `<prefix>-*`.
- **Oracle**: prefix match per enumerated item; an exhausted population
  with zero mismatches decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the registered prefix comes from the
  project's registration, not from the observation output.
- **Falsifier**: one served item whose identifier is outside the
  registered prefix.

#### Scenario: Only prefix-scoped items served

- **WHEN** the machine answer serves N work items for a project
  registered under prefix `bu`
- **THEN** all N identifiers begin `bu-`

  topology: []
  parent_requirements: []
```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-012 — The passive export is never a work-item source

Group: Work-item observation. Form: **prohibition**.

The POC SHALL NOT read work-item facts from the Beads JSONL export or
any derived file; the Dolt database is the only work-item source. Scope
of quantification: every work-item fact served in either channel.

- **Case (counterexample schema + sweep)**: a checker mutates the JSONL
  export to disagree with the Dolt database on one item's status, then
  triggers observation and reads both channels. The denominator is
  every served fact about that item.
- **Observable**: served facts follow the database, never the mutated
  export.
- **Oracle**: compare the served status against both sources; equality
  with the database and inequality with the export decides.
- **Oracle independence**: both expected values are read directly from
  the two sources by the checker.
- **Falsifier**: any served fact matching the mutated export against
  the database, or observation failing because the export is absent.

#### Scenario: Divergent export ignored

- **WHEN** the JSONL export disagrees with the Dolt database on an
  item's status and observation runs
- **THEN** the served status equals the database's value, and deleting
  the export entirely does not change the observation

  parent_requirements: []
```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-013 — An unreadable work-item source renders Unknown

Group: Work-item observation. Form: **event-response**.

WHEN the Beads Dolt database is absent, unreachable, or unreadable, the
POC SHALL serve the work-item region as Unknown with a named reason on
both channels, and Trajectory SHALL render that Unknown state — never
an empty board presented as "no work".

- **Case**: a checker makes the database unreachable and requests both
  channels.
- **Observable**: the work-item region carries `Unknown` and a reason;
  Trajectory shows its Unknown rendering, visually distinct from an
  empty-but-observed board.
- **Oracle**: the served epistemic label equals `Unknown` with a
  non-empty reason naming the failure class; and the Trajectory
  rendering carries the Unknown marker, not the zero-items marker.
- **Oracle independence**: the checker induced and independently knows
  the failure.
- **Falsifier**: an empty kanban rendered without an Unknown marker, a
  reason-less Unknown, or stale items served as current without their
  observation revision.

#### Scenario: Database unreachable

- **WHEN** the Dolt database cannot be read at observation time
- **THEN** both channels serve the work-item region Unknown with a
  named reason, and Trajectory renders that state distinctly from an
  observed-empty board

  topology: []
  parent_requirements: []
```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-020 — Client-rendered facts are the shared model's facts

Group: Client rendering and parity. Form: **invariant**.

Every fact a client-rendered surface presents SHALL be present, with
equal value, in the machine answer for the same evaluation. Scope of
quantification: all facts rendered by client-side code across the three
surfaces.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker loads each surface, extracts every
  rendered fact through the surfaces' declared parity markers — the
  denominator is the complete marker population, which the check counts
  and reports — and compares each against the machine answer.
- **Observable**: every marked rendered fact has an equal counterpart
  in the machine answer.
- **Oracle**: field-by-field equality over the exhausted marker
  population; the independent parity comparator (not surface code)
  decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the comparator reads the wire outputs of
  both channels; it imports no rendering code.
- **Falsifier**: one rendered fact absent from, or unequal to, the
  machine answer at the same evaluation.

#### Scenario: Surface and machine answer agree

- **WHEN** a surface renders N marked facts at evaluation E
- **THEN** all N appear with equal values in `GET /api/poc` for E, and
  the check reports N as its denominator

```yaml
warrants:
  primary: VIS-1
  doctrine: [VIS-1, VIS-3, VIS-7]

  decisions: [POC-DIR-2026-08-29, POC-DIR-2026-08-30]
  topology: []
  parent_requirements: []
```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-021 — Client code is a build output, never fetched at runtime

Group: Client rendering and parity. Form: **prohibition**.

The POC SHALL NOT load executable client code from outside its own
built, version-controlled outputs: no runtime fetch of scripts from
external origins. Scope of quantification: every script the served
pages cause a browser to execute.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker enumerates every script reference in the
  served pages and every network origin contacted during page load —
  the denominator is the complete reference set.
- **Observable**: all executable references resolve to the POC's own
  served build outputs.
- **Oracle**: origin check per enumerated reference over the exhausted
  set; zero external executable origins decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the enumeration reads served bytes and
  observed network activity, not the build configuration.
- **Falsifier**: one script reference to an origin outside the POC's
  own serving.

#### Scenario: Offline page load

- **WHEN** a served page loads with all external network origins
  blocked
- **THEN** every surface still renders fully from the POC's own served
  assets

```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-022 — Script-less reading still gets honest facts

Group: Client rendering and parity. Form: **event-response**.

WHEN a human surface is read without script execution, the POC SHALL
still serve the surface's facts in exact, accessible form (the
server-rendered exact tables/routes), or an explicit statement that the
enhanced rendering is unavailable — never a blank or silently degraded
region presented as complete.

- **Case**: a checker requests each surface with scripting disabled and
  reads the served HTML.
- **Observable**: the facts remain reachable through server-rendered
  exact form, or the region explicitly states its unavailability.
- **Oracle**: for a sampled fact set, presence in the no-script served
  HTML (or presence of the explicit unavailability statement); string
  comparison decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the sampled expected facts come from the
  machine answer.
- **Falsifier**: a region that renders empty without an unavailability
  statement when scripts are disabled.

#### Scenario: No-script request

- **WHEN** a surface page is fetched and rendered without JavaScript
- **THEN** its facts are served in exact server-rendered form, or the
  region explicitly discloses that the spatial/board rendering is
  unavailable without script

### Requirement: POC-REQ-030 — Polaris renders a multi-page long-form narrative from intent facts

Group: Polaris. Form: **state projection/query**.

WHEN Polaris is read, it SHALL project the shared model's intent
entities as a long-form narrative document in multiple titled
pages/sections, each section traceable to the entity or entities it
presents.

- **Case**: a checker loads Polaris at a known evaluation with a known
  entity set.
- **Observable**: a paginated/sectioned document whose sections carry
  entity references.
- **Oracle**: for each intent entity in the machine answer, at least
  one Polaris section references it, and each section's references
  resolve to model entities; resolution over the enumerated entity set
  decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the entity list comes from the machine
  answer, not from Polaris's rendering.
- **Falsifier**: an intent entity absent from every section, or a
  section presenting substantive content traceable to no entity.

#### Scenario: Narrative covers the intent entities

- **WHEN** the shared model holds N intent entities and Polaris is
  loaded
- **THEN** the document presents titled sections in which each of the N
  entities is referenced, and no section's substantive claims lack an
  entity reference

```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-031 — Every positive Polaris claim carries resolvable provenance

Group: Polaris. Form: **invariant**.

Every positive claim Polaris presents SHALL cite provenance that
resolves to an identified observation or governed artifact in the
shared model. Scope of quantification: all claim-bearing elements
Polaris marks (its declared claim markers).

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker enumerates Polaris's claim markers — the
  denominator is the complete marker population, counted and reported —
  and resolves each citation against the machine answer.
- **Observable**: every marked claim's citation resolves.
- **Oracle**: resolution per marker over the exhausted population; zero
  dangling citations decides.
- **Oracle independence**: resolution targets come from the machine
  answer.
- **Falsifier**: one marked positive claim with no citation, or a
  citation resolving to nothing.

#### Scenario: Claims resolve

- **WHEN** Polaris renders M marked claims
- **THEN** all M citations resolve against the shared model, and the
  check reports M as its denominator

```

### Requirement: POC-REQ-032 — Polaris never fills evidence gaps with narrative

Group: Polaris. Form: **prohibition**.

Polaris SHALL NOT present prose asserting states of the project for
which the shared model holds no evidence; where the model is Unknown,
the narrative SHALL disclose the Unknown and its reason in place. Scope
of quantification: every substantive assertion in the rendered
document.

- **Case (counterexample schema + sweep)**: a checker takes a model
  whose relationships include declared Unknowns, renders Polaris, and
  sweeps every marked assertion — the denominator is the marked
  assertion population — verifying that no assertion speaks positively
  about an Unknown relationship.
- **Observable**: Unknown regions appear as disclosed Unknowns inside
  the narrative flow.
- **Oracle**: for each model Unknown, the document's corresponding
  section carries the Unknown disclosure and no positive assertion
  cites that relationship; the marker sweep decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the Unknown list comes from the machine
  answer.
- **Falsifier**: prose asserting verification, health, or completion
  for a relationship the model holds as Unknown.

#### Scenario: Unknown disclosed in the narrative

- **WHEN** the shared model holds the test-evidence relationship as
  Unknown
- **THEN** Polaris's corresponding section states the Unknown and its
  reason, and no section asserts test success

### Requirement: POC-REQ-040 — Trajectory columns come from the closed status vocabulary

Group: Trajectory. Form: **state projection/query**.

WHEN Trajectory is read, it SHALL project observed work items onto
board columns drawn from a declared closed mapping of the Beads status
vocabulary, with every rendered item placed by its observed status and
carrying its identifier.

- **Case**: a checker loads Trajectory at a known Dolt revision with
  known item statuses.
- **Observable**: each rendered item sits in the column its observed
  status maps to.
- **Oracle**: per sampled item, the rendered column equals the declared
  mapping applied to the status read directly from Dolt at the served
  revision; equality decides.
- **Oracle independence**: expected statuses are direct database reads.
- **Falsifier**: an item rendered in a column that contradicts its
  observed status, or a column outside the declared mapping.

#### Scenario: Items placed by observed status

- **WHEN** an item's status in the Dolt database at revision D is
  `in_progress`
- **THEN** Trajectory at the observation of D renders that item in the
  column the declared mapping assigns to `in_progress`

### Requirement: POC-REQ-041 — Trajectory's time visualization uses recorded instants only

Group: Trajectory. Form: **invariant**.

Every temporal position, duration, or ordering Trajectory renders SHALL
derive from instants recorded in the observed work-item facts (created,
updated, closed), never from render-time clocks or inferred ordering.
Scope of quantification: all temporal encodings on the surface.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker enumerates Trajectory's temporal markers
  — the denominator is the marker population — and recomputes each
  position from the machine answer's recorded instants.
- **Observable**: rendered positions match recomputation; re-rendering
  later without a new observation changes nothing.
- **Oracle**: recomputation equality per marker, and byte-equality of
  temporal encodings across two renders of one observation at different
  wall-clock times.
- **Oracle independence**: recomputation uses the machine answer's
  instants and a checker-owned formula.
- **Falsifier**: a temporal encoding that shifts between renders of the
  same observation, or one not derivable from recorded instants.

#### Scenario: Same observation, later render

- **WHEN** one observation is rendered at two different wall-clock
  times
- **THEN** every temporal encoding is identical across the two renders

### Requirement: POC-REQ-042 — Trajectory declares its scope and denominator

Group: Trajectory. Form: **invariant**.

Trajectory SHALL visibly declare which work-item population it renders
(its selection rule) and the counts inside and outside that selection,
so an excluded-item population is never silently invisible. Scope of
quantification: the rendered scope statement against the full observed
item set.

- **Case**: a checker loads Trajectory over a database whose total item
  count exceeds the rendered selection.
- **Observable**: the surface states the selection rule, the rendered
  count, and the excluded count.
- **Oracle**: rendered count + excluded count equals the total count
  read directly from Dolt at the served revision; arithmetic decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the total comes from a direct database
  count.
- **Falsifier**: a board whose counts do not reconcile with the
  database total, or no visible scope statement.

#### Scenario: Bounded board over a large history

- **WHEN** the database holds 6,964 items and Trajectory renders a
  selection of 192
- **THEN** the surface states the selection rule and that 6,772 items
  are outside it, and the three numbers reconcile

### Requirement: POC-REQ-043 — Activity is never rendered as satisfaction

Group: Trajectory. Form: **prohibition**.

Trajectory SHALL NOT render work-item activity, closure, or merge state
as intent satisfaction or verification. Scope of quantification: every
satisfaction/verification encoding on the surface.

- **Case (counterexample schema + sweep)**: a checker closes an
  observed item whose governing relationship holds no verification
  evidence, re-observes, and sweeps Trajectory's rendered encodings for
  that item — the denominator is that item's full rendered marker set.
- **Observable**: the item shows closed/merged state and the
  verification relationship stays visibly not-verified/Unknown.
- **Oracle**: the rendered verification encoding equals the machine
  answer's relationship state (not the item's activity state); equality
  decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the relationship state comes from the
  machine answer; the checker induced the mismatch.
- **Falsifier**: a closed or merged item rendered with a verified,
  satisfied, or green encoding while its relationship lacks evidence.

#### Scenario: Closed but unverified

- **WHEN** an observed item is closed and no verification artifact has
  been ingested
- **THEN** Trajectory renders the closure as activity and the
  verification state as not verified/Unknown, distinctly encoded

### Requirement: POC-REQ-050 — Orrery projects declared mappings deterministically

Group: Orrery. Form: **state projection/query**.

WHEN Orrery is read, it SHALL render a spatial projection of the
observed code structure in which regions derive from the directory
structure and declared capability-to-path mappings, with a
deterministic layout per observation.

- **Case**: a checker loads Orrery twice over one observation and once
  over a second observation at the same revision.
- **Observable**: spatial regions correspond to observed directories
  and declared mappings; layout assignments repeat exactly.
- **Oracle**: per sampled region, the backing directory/mapping exists
  in the machine answer; and layout assignments are equal across
  renders of equal observations. Equality decides.
- **Oracle independence**: expected structure comes from the machine
  answer; layout comparison is a generic diff.
- **Falsifier**: a rendered region backed by no observed directory or
  declared mapping, or two renders of one observation with differing
  layouts.

#### Scenario: Stable city over one observation

- **WHEN** Orrery renders the same code-structure observation twice
- **THEN** every region's position and extent is identical, and every
  region resolves to an observed path or declared mapping

### Requirement: POC-REQ-051 — Unmapped code is a visible Unknown region with a denominator

Group: Orrery. Form: **invariant**.

Orrery SHALL render observed code outside every declared mapping as an
explicit unmapped/Unknown region, and SHALL state the mapped and
unmapped counts against the observed total. Scope of quantification:
every observed file in the structure observation.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker counts observed files directly from the
  machine answer, and reads Orrery's mapped/unmapped counts — the
  denominator is the observed file total.
- **Observable**: an explicit unmapped region with counts that
  reconcile.
- **Oracle**: mapped + unmapped equals the observed total; arithmetic
  over the exhausted file population decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the total is recomputed from the machine
  answer's inventory.
- **Falsifier**: observed files absent from both the mapped regions and
  the unmapped count, or no visible unmapped region when unmapped files
  exist.

#### Scenario: Partial mapping disclosed

- **WHEN** 1,240 files are observed and declared mappings cover 310
- **THEN** Orrery renders the mapped regions, an explicit Unknown
  region for the 930 unmapped files, and the counts reconcile to 1,240

### Requirement: POC-REQ-052 — Orrery never infers relationships

Group: Orrery. Form: **prohibition**.

Orrery SHALL NOT render an edge, adjacency, grouping, or emphasis
encoding a relationship the shared model does not hold. Scope of
quantification: every relationship encoding the surface's legend
declares.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker enumerates every rendered relationship
  encoding per the legend — the denominator is the enumerated encoding
  population — and resolves each against the machine answer's
  relationship set.
- **Observable**: every encoded relationship exists in the model.
- **Oracle**: resolution per encoding over the exhausted population;
  zero unresolved encodings decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the relationship set comes from the machine
  answer.
- **Falsifier**: one rendered edge or declared-meaning adjacency with
  no backing model relationship.

#### Scenario: No proximity-invented edges

- **WHEN** two code regions are rendered adjacent for layout reasons
  only
- **THEN** no legend-declared relationship encoding connects them, and
  every rendered edge resolves to a model relationship

### Requirement: POC-REQ-053 — Every Orrery entity resolves to its exact route

Group: Orrery. Form: **invariant**.

Every entity Orrery renders SHALL link to the same entity route the
exact tables serve, so the spatial view and the exact view are two
projections of one graph. Scope of quantification: all interactive
entity elements on the surface.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker enumerates every interactive entity
  element — the denominator is that population — and follows each link.
- **Observable**: each link resolves to the entity's exact
  representation.
- **Oracle**: HTTP/anchor resolution per enumerated element; zero
  dangling links over the exhausted population decides.
- **Oracle independence**: the route table comes from the served exact
  view, not Orrery's code.
- **Falsifier**: one spatial entity whose link is dangling or resolves
  to a different entity.

#### Scenario: Spatial and exact agree

- **WHEN** Orrery renders K interactive entities
- **THEN** all K links resolve to the matching exact-table routes, and
  the check reports K as its denominator

### Requirement: POC-REQ-060 — One design language, one epistemic encoding

Group: Cross-cutting experience. Form: **invariant**.

The three surfaces SHALL draw from one declared set of design tokens,
and SHALL encode epistemic states (Observed, Unknown, and their
reasons) identically wherever they appear. Scope of quantification:
every epistemic encoding across the three surfaces.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker enumerates every epistemic encoding on
  all three surfaces — the denominator is that population — and
  compares each against the declared token/encoding table.
- **Observable**: identical states render with identical declared
  encodings on every surface.
- **Oracle**: per-encoding equality with the declared table over the
  exhausted population; the table is a checked-in declaration.
- **Oracle independence**: the declared table is the expected value;
  the sweep reads served output.
- **Falsifier**: one surface encoding Unknown (or Observed) differently
  from the declared table, or a surface styling epistemic state ad hoc.

#### Scenario: Unknown looks the same everywhere

- **WHEN** the same Unknown relationship appears on Polaris,
  Trajectory, and Orrery
- **THEN** all three render it with the declared Unknown encoding from
  the shared token set

### Requirement: POC-REQ-061 — The accessibility floor holds on every surface

Group: Cross-cutting experience. Form: **invariant**.

Every surface SHALL be navigable by keyboard with visible focus, SHALL
meet WCAG AA contrast for text and epistemic encodings, SHALL respect
reduced-motion preferences, and SHALL carry legends whose text matches
every visual encoding in use. Scope of quantification: all interactive
elements, text/encoding color pairs, animated behaviors, and
legend-declared encodings on the three surfaces.

- **Case (sweep)**: a checker runs keyboard traversal, automated
  contrast measurement over the enumerated color pairs,
  reduced-motion-preference rendering, and a legend-to-encoding
  comparison; each sweep reports its denominator.
- **Observable**: full traversal reaches every interactive element with
  visible focus; measured pairs meet AA; animations are absent under
  reduced motion; every legend entry matches a live encoding and vice
  versa.
- **Oracle**: per-sweep pass over its exhausted population; measured
  ratios and element counts decide.
- **Oracle independence**: contrast is measured from served styles by a
  generic tool; the legend comparison reads served output.
- **Falsifier**: an unreachable interactive element, a failing measured
  pair, an animation surviving reduced-motion preference, or a legend
  entry matching no rendered encoding.

#### Scenario: Keyboard-only reading

- **WHEN** a keyboard-only reader traverses each surface
- **THEN** every interactive element is reachable with visible focus,
  in an order that follows the surface's reading structure
