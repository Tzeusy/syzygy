**A Polaris dossier can be written by the operator's own Claude Code or Codex
session over a local clone, while Syzygy checks every quotation against the
pinned Git objects, runs a fresh-context review step and renders the pages,
and makes no provider call itself.** This change adds that operator-agent mode
to the `polaris-generation` capability, beside the provider mode the adopted
requirements describe.

## Why

On 2026-10-05 the owner wrote that dossier generation "should be purely done
by a human using claude-code or codex, a provided syzygy binary, and the
target codebase cloned locally", with no API key, and then directed the mode. The adopted generator requirements
assume the opposite: Syzygy calls the model through a registered provider
route, under stage budgets it enforces, with provider receipts for usage, an
independent inventory and review that Syzygy dispatches, and a discovery
account Syzygy produces from its own reads. Those requirements cannot be met
literally when the model runs in the operator's session, and meeting them by
pretence (receipts Syzygy never saw, a "registered route" that is the
operator's terminal) would break VIS-2. The direction routes the change
through one reviewed CC-REV-2 delta.

## What changes

- **Added:** four requirements, 033 to 036, in the existing
  `polaris-generation` capability:
  - 033 Operator-agent authoring mode: mode selection, the governed
    predicate and per-project statement, clone pinning to a consented
    revision, isolated and re-hashed Git-object reads, the SEC-3-gated
    execution rule, no provider call, the operator's declared limits and
    model, unobserved agent usage, records re-derived rather than trusted,
    and the disclosure.
  - 034 Agent brief and mechanically checked draft: the brief, the
    self-reported understanding record, the labelling, citation and
    quotation rules, the draft schema, the quote, path and label checks with
    repair findings, and rendering with RFC7-10 evidence-artifact anchors.
  - 035 Fresh-context review in the operator-agent mode: inventory and review
    contexts, the review packet, verdict validation, and what independence
    can and cannot be shown.
  - 036 Self-reported discovery and in-session clarification.
- **Modified in effect, not in bytes:** for an operator-agent run the new
  requirements displace or read named text of REQ-polaris-generation-001,
  002, 005, 006, 017, 018, 020, 022, 030 and 031, and of the base change's
  `INTERFACES.md`
  (Provider bullet; "Budget and retry decisions"). Each displaced sentence is
  quoted in the semantic delta. For a provider-mode run nothing changes.
- **RFC7-20, by the owner's reading, not by edit:** the owner ruled that
  RFC7-20's consent condition governs drafts Syzygy computes, and that an
  operator-computed draft is admitted with disclosure, a declared and
  recorded tool and provider, and byte-verified quotes (rulings direction,
  item 1). REQ-polaris-generation-001's draft-layer sentence is read
  accordingly in 033. The first review found the reading changes the
  clause's effect; the owner kept the ruling and directed that the finding be
  preserved for the owner, not resolved (review-1 rulings, item 3).
- **Execution follows SEC-3 until it is amended.** The owner chose to let
  the agent build and run the observed project on the host and directed a
  SEC-3 amendment to permit it (review-1 rulings, item 1), drafted as D9.
  The brief invites execution only when D9 is in force, the operator is the
  owner attending sessions the owner started on the owner's host, and the
  owner's choice is recorded before the brief; otherwise it quotes SEC-3 and
  invites nothing outside an execution profile, and this change may not be
  signed before D9 is adopted. Claims the agent marks as resting on
  execution are Inferred and shown with the commands they name; Syzygy
  itself executes and launches no observed code.
- **Parked, not withdrawn:** the provider mode and its route, egress and
  adapter packages, per the direction's item 4.

## Capabilities

- **Modified:** `polaris-generation`, by four added requirements.
- **New:** none. The mode is a way of running the same generator, in the way
  requirements 030 and 031 extended it.

## Amendment relation

- It amends the composition of `openspec/changes/polaris-manifesto-generation/`
  and `openspec/changes/polaris-manifesto-understanding-amendment/`, as
  amended by the tree-form adoption. No byte of either is edited.
- It is independent of the candidate
  `openspec/changes/polaris-non-governed-narrative-profile/` (requirement 032)
  in category: 032 says how a non-governed subject's narrative is composed,
  this change says who authors it and how Syzygy checks it. They share one
  thing, the predicate that decides whether a subject is governed. 033
  counts every `.syzygy/` path, because a path listing cannot tell adoption,
  so it is never less strict than 032's "adopted capability declaration";
  whichever of the two is adopted second reconciles the two definitions. A Redis
  dossier needs both. The numbers 033 to 036 follow 032; if 032 is never
  adopted the gap stays, because identifiers are never renumbered.
- **The candidate delta is held in `proposed/`, not `specs/`,** for the reason
  the profile change gives: `scripts/count_polaris_effective_scenarios.py`
  requires exactly one base and one overlay. Placing it in `specs/` is a step
  of adoption, taken with that script's generalization (`tasks.md`).
- Never archive or sync this as an unrelated competing change.

## Scope and preserved boundaries

- **Syzygy's own reads keep every gate.** Observation consent, the observer
  registry entry, and the classification and screening policy acts apply to
  every Git object Syzygy reads, unchanged (direction item 3).
- **Who sends is the ruling, not whether consent is needed.** The agent's
  sends to its provider are the operator's own act (direction item 2). Every
  transmission Syzygy itself makes still traverses the egress check of
  REQ-polaris-generation-025; in this mode Syzygy makes none.
- **Unobservable things stay Inferred or unrecorded.** What the agent read,
  how much it spent and whether its review contexts were fresh are
  operator-declared or self-reported, and the page says so. Only Syzygy's own
  reads, checks and steps are Observed.
- **Any repository, SEC-2 kept whole.** The owner allowed the mode on any
  repository (scope record, item 1; review-1 rulings, item 2). A subject
  governed under 032's four conditions, or silent about them, needs an
  in-force per-project statement naming the operator's agent provider,
  SEC-2's "explicit, recorded, per-project consent". The statement is a
  consent record; neither its content classes nor SEC-5 screening bind what
  the agent reads or sends, and every page says so.
- **Syzygy's records within the agent's reach.** On a single-user host the
  agent can write Syzygy's state directory. As the owner ruled (R1,
  `POLARIS-DOSSIER-LOCAL-AGENT-RECORDS-2026-10-05`), nothing Observed rests
  on a stored record and every value shown from one is labelled Inferred.
  That reads REQ-polaris-generation-018 and 022 for this mode. The reading
  of 020's work-item gates, and option A's fuller cost (agent-editable
  refusal records, stored pinned revision and packets), go to the owner with
  the sign-off.
- **Reviews in sessions the operator starts.** Separate top-level sessions
  the operator starts, in a new terminal or by typing `!` and the printed
  command in the authoring session's terminal; never a subagent, and never a
  headless session the authoring agent starts (scope record, item 2).
  Admitting `!` is the lead's reading of the owner's words, not an owner
  ruling: the `!` launch is the same headless command, a child of the
  authoring tool's shell whose output lands in the author's context, and
  only who typed it differs. The owner's sign-off covers that reading.
- **What the agent ran is its report.** Commands the agent says it ran are
  recorded as its report, labelled Inferred; Syzygy cannot observe them.
- **No new permission.** This is not permission to read, egress, write,
  execute observed code, deploy, release or adopt intent.

## Impact

- **Generation core:** a local-agent draft schema and adapter onto the
  existing quote check, schema validation, review validation and dossier
  evaluation.
- **App:** a `syzygy dossier` command family (design only: `design.md`), the
  consent reader of PR #263 (on `main`), isolated, re-hashed Git-object
  reads by identifier, and the existing dossier renderer.
- **Agent harness:** a thin Claude Code skill and Codex instructions that
  drive the loop (text in `design.md`; not installed by this change).
- **Authority unchanged.** The generator's authority remains what its
  performed acts say. Implementation that depends on this change waits for
  the owner's sign-off (direction item 5).
