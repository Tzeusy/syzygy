> **Approved** — owner decision D2 (2026-08-01), amendment B21 applied where noted. **This directory (`.syzygy/governance/policies/craft-and-care/`) is the canonical home of these policies.** The bootstrap-phase copy is preserved separately as historical review evidence. Binding force on implementation work begins with the owner's digest-bound acceptance of the foundational design contracts (the act defined in the active acceptance record; the policies cite RFC clauses that bind nothing until then).

# Interfaces and dependencies

Baseline: the canonical `dependency-hygiene` bar applies by reference —
dependencies point from less stable to more stable; no cycles; minimal
deliberate public surface; no god-modules; third-party packages pay rent;
versions pinned, upgrades deliberate; test/dev dependencies out of production
chains. Syzygy's additions concern identity stability, its schema-versioned
namespace, typed adapters, and a deliberately two-phased dependency posture.

## CC-DEP-1 — Liberal experimentation, disciplined promotion

The owner's dependency character is **"liberal experimentation, disciplined
promotion"** [Observed — FD-029, amending FD-020 E8; recorded in the founder
decision log, not in adopted doctrine text]. Encoded as two regimes with an
explicit boundary:

- **Experimentation is liberal.** In spikes, prototypes, and any scope
  declared experimental, dependency admission is unencumbered — velocity
  first. Experimental scope must be *declared and bounded* (a marked
  branch, directory, or artifact status naming what it covers): nothing in
  it is authoritative or shippable, and a declaration that sweeps an
  authoritative or shipped path into "experimental" is a violation, not a
  classification call — the regime boundary is where the discipline lives.
- **Promotion is disciplined — and reviewed.** A dependency enters a
  shipped or authoritative path only through a recorded promotion decision
  applying the canonical rent test (what it saves over owned code;
  maintenance health; standard-library preference) and pinning. The
  promotion decision is **reviewed by a non-author** (CC-BAR-6 — the agent
  that wants the dependency never writes its own admission ticket), and
  the record lives at the project's **named dependency-record home** (the
  single location where the project documents dependencies — fixed by RFC
  or project convention, not chosen per-promotion), never scattered into
  commit bodies. Volatile or heavy dependencies are wrapped behind an
  owned seam at promotion; stable idiomatic ones are not.
- **Pruning is a ritual, not an accident.** Unpromoted experimental
  dependencies and rent-delinquent promoted ones are removed on a recurring
  review whose **cadence is declared in the same named dependency-record
  home** — a "recurring review" with no declared cadence is unfalsifiable
  and does not satisfy this clause. Cadence *values* are project detail;
  the obligation to declare one is not [Observed — INTERVIEW_NOTES E8:
  "prune later" carried into craft as a prune ritual].

*Violation:* a visualization library pulled into a spike, then reaching the
released rendering path because the spike branch was merged wholesale — no
promotion decision, no pin record, no seam.

## CC-DEP-2 — Stable identities anchor everything

Kernel entities — capabilities, claims, gaps, work items, evidence artifacts,
components — carry durable identities independent of file paths and layout
(SDR-2 two-level identity; architecture.md: the map anchors to capability
identities, not file paths, and refactoring must not randomly relocate it).
Interface and storage designs must therefore:

- key on the durable identity, with substrate-native identifiers as
  qualified aliases, never primary keys (e.g. the abstract work identity is
  primary; a scheduler-native id like `bead_id` is its substrate-qualified
  alias) [Inferred — from the typed-adapter model; envelope analysis in the
  non-authoritative observation brief reaches the same conclusion];
- count and aggregate by identity, not by location (SDR-22);
- treat identity re-minting (split/merge/rename) as a recorded event with
  continuity links, per the scheme RFC 0001 will fix.

*Violation:* a component's history keyed on its directory path, so one
rename orphans its evidence trail and the map "forgets" the component.

## CC-DEP-3 — `.syzygy/**` is schema-versioned; migrations are identity-preserving

`.syzygy/**` is Syzygy's native, schema-versioned namespace; it evolves only
through **explicit, reviewable, identity-preserving migrations**
[Observed — architecture.md, schema ownership]. Policy:

- every stored artifact carries its schema version; readers reject or
  explicitly adapt unknown versions — never silently guess;
- a migration is its own reviewed change (mandatory independent review,
  CC-REV-1 class 5), stating what it preserves and proving durable
  identities and evidence records survive round-trip;
- migrations never rewrite immutable records (observation records,
  materialization records, execution evidence) — representation may be
  re-encoded, identity and content-integrity must be re-verifiable;
- `openspec/**` is the opposite regime: Syzygy writes it only in
  OpenSpec-compatible form and never reorganizes it for its own convenience.

*Violation:* a storage refactor that regenerates all evidence-artifact IDs
under a new scheme with no mapping table — every historical citation and
hash link dangles.

## CC-DEP-4 — External effects only through typed, explicitly authorized adapters

No code path affects an external authority — version control, the work
scheduler, CI, runtime systems — except through a typed adapter with
explicit authorization, honoring that authority's own contract (VIS-5;
architecture.md). Adapter contracts are substrate-neutral: the adapter's
consumer speaks the kernel vocabulary; substrate specifics stay inside the
adapter. Adapters support resolvable spec anchors, and their absence renders
Unknown rather than rejecting the project (SDR-32).

*Violation:* a convenience helper that shells out to the scheduler's CLI
from surface code "just this once," bypassing the typed adapter and its
authorization check.

## CC-DEP-5 — Public interfaces are contracts with a compatibility story

Machine-queryable endpoints are first-class product surface from V0
(v1.md) — agents are consumers with the same truth guarantees as the owner.
Every public interface (endpoints, adapter contracts, exported schemas):

- is versioned, with breaking changes made deliberately, announced in the
  interface's own contract, and independently reviewed (CC-REV-1 class 6);
- exposes epistemic state faithfully — Observed/Inferred/Unknown labels and
  freshness travel through the API; no endpoint "simplifies" Unknown away
  for consumer convenience (VIS-1 applies to machine consumers too);
- exposes what its contract promises and no more (canonical
  dependency-hygiene rule 3) — internal kernel structures are not
  reachable by accident.

*Violation:* an endpoint that flattens `status: unknown (no current
evidence)` to `status: ok` because a consuming workflow "only handles
ok/fail."

## CC-DEP-6 — One kernel; surfaces never fork semantics

Shared semantics live in the kernel and its contracts; the three surfaces
are projections and may not define surface-local variants of kernel meanings
(architecture.md, one kernel three surfaces; SDR §1). A surface needing a
new semantic goes through the kernel contract change, not a local helper
that reinterprets shared data.

*Violation:* one surface locally redefining "stale" with a longer horizon
than the kernel's, so two surfaces disagree about the same record's
freshness.
