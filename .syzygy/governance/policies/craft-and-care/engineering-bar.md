> **Approved** — owner decision D2 (2026-08-01), amendment B21 applied where noted. **This directory (`.syzygy/governance/policies/craft-and-care/`) is the canonical home of these policies.** The bootstrap-phase copy is preserved separately as historical review evidence. Binding force on implementation work begins with the owner's digest-bound acceptance of the foundational design contracts (the act defined in the active acceptance record; the policies cite RFC clauses that bind nothing until then).

# Engineering bar — Syzygy definition of done and merge/release constraints

Baseline: the canonical `th-engineering` engineering-bar (biases 1–9,
Definition of Done) applies by reference. This file records Syzygy's
additions: what "done" additionally requires here, what may not merge, what
may not release, and the floors no implementing agent may lower.

## CC-BAR-1 — Canonical bar adopted; precedence fixed

The canonical bar's default biases and Definition of Done are Syzygy's
baseline. On conflict: adopted doctrine and owner rulings > this cluster >
canonical bar (README). Overrides of the canonical bar are recorded at the
policy where they occur and indexed here — the register currently holds
three:

1. canonical bias 1 ("prefer cleanup over same-repo compatibility cruft")
   does **not** license deleting or renumbering identity-bearing artifacts —
   rule identifiers, entity IDs, evidence identities, and migration history
   are retired, never renumbered or erased (this clause; see CC-DEP-2,
   CC-REV-7);
2. canonical test-rigor rule 2 (a fix without a failing-then-passing test is
   unverified — no exceptions) is overridden by CC-TEST-1's rare,
   recorded-infeasibility exception clause, as the phase charter requires;
3. canonical test-rigor rule 6 ("never retry-until-green") is overridden by
   CC-TEST-4's narrowly conditioned infrastructure-retry clause.

An unregistered modification of the canonical bar is itself a violation:
the README's re-check-on-bar-change mechanism can only re-check overrides
it can find.

*Violation:* a cleanup pass that renumbers `CC-TEST-*` policies to close a
gap left by a retired rule, breaking every existing citation.

## CC-BAR-2 — Syzygy definition of done

A non-trivial change is done only when, in addition to the canonical
Definition of Done:

1. every authoritative artifact the change invalidates — behavioral specs,
   declared topology, contracts, policies — is updated in the **same logical
   change** (the unified same-change rule; CC-REV-2 states it fully), with
   the one carve-out that doctrine amendments route through the owner gate
   rather than being edited in-change [Observed — FD-020 E1-b/E10, founder
   decision log];
2. verification evidence is a **retained, resolvable artifact**, not an
   assertion in a message or transcript (CC-TEST-3; SDR-9);
3. any new Unknown the change introduces into a surface is rendered as
   Unknown, never defaulted to a confident state (VIS-2, SDR-6);
4. the change record states which risk floors (CC-BAR-5) it touched, or
   "none" — and where the change takes review, the reviewer **confirms**
   that statement; a false "none" is a review failure at the time, and a
   findable violation after the fact.

*Violation:* a change that alters observed-graph semantics, updates the code
and tests, and leaves the governing contract text describing the old
semantics "to fix later."

## CC-BAR-3 — Comprehensible truth is a merge constraint

VIS-1 and VIS-3 are enforced at merge time, not aspirationally:

- A change may not merge if it causes any surface to render a confident
  state where the underlying state is Unknown, or to simplify **content**
  rather than **presentation** (VIS-1's boundary: honest aggregation of
  Unknowns is fine; substituting a neighbor's green for an Unknown is not).
- A change to a normative artifact may not merge if it degrades that
  artifact below the fresh-reader bar (VIS-3): a reader without authoring
  context must be able to restate its intent and constraints. Reviewers
  reject on this ground alone, independent of functional correctness. (This
  merge constraint always holds and any reviewer may enforce it at any
  merge; the *formal* fresh-reader review runs on SDR-14's schedule —
  CC-REV-4. The two are not in conflict: the constraint is continuous, the
  ceremony is scheduled.)

*Violation:* an LLM-authored spec edit that is functionally accurate but
compresses three constraints into jargon only the authoring session can
unpack — merged because "the tests still pass."

## CC-BAR-4 — No green without current evidence is a release constraint

No Syzygy release ships a code path that can declare alignment, convergence,
genome-completeness, or any green/success state without a current,
resolvable evidence trail judged at an identified evaluation (VIS-2;
trust-and-evidence.md). Concretely, at release review:

- every status-rendering path is traceable to the evidence class and
  currency bound that authorizes it; a claim class without a declared
  currency bound renders Unknown [Observed — trust-and-evidence.md];
- the trust floor (deterministic-layer identity, resolvable internal links,
  faithful legends, no secret material) is **release-blocking for Syzygy's
  own releases** (VIS-7) — a change that breaks it is rejectable regardless
  of whether it otherwise works.

*Violation:* shipping a portfolio dashboard whose project tiles default to
green when the observation index is missing, on the argument that "most
projects are fine."

## CC-BAR-5 — Risk floors no implementing agent may downgrade

The following are floors. An implementing agent — human-directed or fleet —
may **strengthen** them in a change; it may never weaken, waive,
special-case, or "temporarily" bypass them. Only the owner, through the
artifact that owns each floor (doctrine amendment or owner ruling), can
change them. The floors, named:

1. **Truth floor** — deterministic-layer identity per identified
   evaluation; every rendered internal link resolves; every encoding means
   what its legend says; no secret in any surface, store, or endpoint
   (VIS-7; trust-and-evidence.md).
2. **Evidence floor** — no green/positive status without current evidence;
   missing evidence renders Unknown, never success, never zero (VIS-2;
   SDR-6).
3. **Inference floor** — inference holds challenge authority only; it never
   establishes or raises a positive status claim, and is never rendered
   indistinguishable from observed fact (trust-and-evidence.md).
4. **Write floor** — direct writes confined to `openspec/**` and
   `.syzygy/**`; all other effects through typed, explicitly authorized
   adapters; Syzygy never writes implementation code (VIS-5).
5. **Sign-off floor** — shape-defining deltas require owner sign-off;
   security-posture, privacy/retention, and normative-data-contract spec
   changes are always human-gated (VIS-4).
6. **Security floor** — SEC-1 through SEC-5 defaults: authenticated by
   default, consented egress, untrusted observed code, consented/attributed/
   revertable writes, secrets fail closed.
7. **Identity floor** — kernel identities and `.syzygy/**` schema migrations
   are identity-preserving; migrations never orphan or silently re-mint
   durable IDs (CC-DEP-2/3).

*Violation:* a worker agent, blocked by the secret-detection policy on
unclassifiable content, adds a bypass flag "for local development" —
downgrading floor 6's fail-closed behavior without owner authority.

## CC-BAR-6 — Evidence and review scale with declared risk, floors excepted

Verification depth and review intensity scale with a change's declared
complexity/risk class [Observed — FD-020 E2/E9: evidence and review scale
with self-determined complexity]. The implementing agent makes the
**initial** declaration (that is FD-020's efficiency intent), but the
declaration is recorded in the change record, is **contested by default,
and is never finally determined by the agent performing the change** where
it would waive independent review or lower verification depth (mirroring
VIS-4's classification rule): a reviewer or the owner may reclassify, and
a misdeclaration is a findable violation, not a judgment call. Scaling
applies **above** the floors: a trivial change still may not cross
CC-BAR-5, and any change touching a CC-REV-1 mandatory-review class gets
independent review regardless of its self-declared size.

*Violation:* a "one-line" change self-labeled low-complexity that alters the
evaluation-identity computation, merged without independent review because
small diffs skip it.

## CC-BAR-7 — Changes stay reviewable

Unreviewably oversized diffs are rejected as such [Observed — FD-020 E4-e:
"reject … unreviewable oversized diffs"]. A change too large for a reviewer
to reconstruct intent is split before review, not waved through after. This
is the merge-time face of the owner's founding complaint ("oversized diffs,
scattered completions, no coherent account" — vision.md).

*Violation:* a fleet worker delivering a single change that rewrites an
adapter, reorganizes storage schemas, and reformats untouched files, with a
commit message summarizing only the adapter work.
