# RFC 0001 — Project Graph, Identity and State Planes

**Status:** Proposed foundational contract. This line is a self-declaration at authoring time (RFC3-16): effective status is established solely by the owner-act record binding this file's exact content digest, and acceptance edits nothing here. Absent such a record, this contract binds nothing.
**Date:** 2026-07-30 (amended through 2026-08-02)
**Serves:** VIS-1, VIS-2, VIS-3, VIS-4, VIS-5, VIS-6, VIS-7; SEC-2, SEC-4, SEC-5. Implements owner rulings SDR-1, SDR-2, SDR-3, SDR-4, SDR-7, SDR-8, SDR-12, SDR-22, SDR-30, and resolves SDR §5 questions 1–3.

## 0. Reader's summary (non-normative)

*Plain-language orientation. If this section and a clause ever disagree, the
clause wins.*

- This RFC is the **dictionary** everything else uses. It fixes what things
  exist in Syzygy's model (projects, repositories, capabilities, claims,
  evidence, proposals, work items…), who is allowed to create each one's
  identity, and how identities survive renames, splits, and merges.
- Every **source-state assertion** lives in exactly one of **six state
  planes**: Desired (what the
  owner adopted), Proposed (unadopted drafts), Observed (what actually
  exists, backed by evidence), Inferred (challenges — they can cast doubt but
  never confirm anything), Execution (work being done), Historical
  (superseded records). Relation edges and kernel-derived objects occupy
  **no** plane — each relation instead carries a **semantic class** naming
  which plane assertions it derives from.
- The load-bearing rule: **doing work never proves intent is satisfied.**
  Only evidence, read at an identified evaluation, can turn a status green —
  and all status flows through Claims, so every green is challengeable.
- **No evidence means Unknown** — never a guess, never a silent "fine".
- The entity and relation lists are **closed**: additions require an
  amendment carrying an owner decision. Two relations (`declared-dependency`,
  `placed_in`) were added exactly that way at acceptance.
- Conflicting declarations (two governance roots, two placements) are
  surfaced as **contradictions for the owner to adjudicate** — never silently
  repaired by picking one.
- A **Proposal** is the single container for every unadopted change. Approved
  work crosses a one-way door (**materialization**), after which the
  scheduler owns its lifecycle.
- There is deliberately **no "Feature" entity**; Capability is the only
  stable product-behavior identity, and it is what the map anchors to.

Structure: §3 is the contract (clauses RFC1-1 … RFC1-32); §4 gives
recognizable violation cases; §8 lists the owner-visible open questions, with
answered ones marked in place.

## 1. Summary

This RFC defines the semantic kernel every Syzygy surface projects from: the
V0-core entity vocabulary and its extension profiles, the identity scheme for
every identity-bearing class (who mints, what survives split/merge/rename),
the six state planes and the rule that assigns acts to them, the closed V0
relation vocabulary with the single evidence-to-status path, proposal
exclusivity groups, and entity lifecycles. It is **semantics only**: no
storage engine, serialization, database, or query technology is chosen or
implied. Every doctrine-frozen noun gets exactly one kernel construct, or a
recorded deliberate non-reification. The design question routed here by SDR
§5 — the approved-but-unmaterialized plan item — is resolved as a
**lifecycle state of the Proposal entity** (kind: execution intent), not a
new entity and not a scheduler-native epic (§3.8, §6.1).

---

## 2. Motivation and doctrine grounding

Doctrine keeps three states semantically distinct — desired, observed
implementation, execution — and rules that work is never proof intent is
satisfied [Observed: vision.md, Thesis]. It mandates one shared kernel under
three non-authoritative surfaces, map geography anchored to capability
identity rather than file paths [Observed: architecture.md; v1.md], statuses
computed only at identified evaluations (VIS-2, VIS-7), rebuildability with
two closed exceptions (VIS-6), and a trust floor whose link rule requires
every internal reference to resolve to an identified target [Observed:
trust-and-evidence.md, floor]. None of that is achievable without a contract
that fixes *what the entities are, what mints their identities, which
plane every source-state assertion lives in, and which semantic class
every relation edge carries*. Downstream RFCs (0002–0009) and all three
surfaces depend on this vocabulary being closed and stable.

[Inferred] The dominant failure mode this contract guards against is the
**silent default**: an unruled identity question gets answered by whatever
the first implementation does, and the answer becomes load-bearing before
anyone examines it. The fresh-context review of the research corpus found
exactly this class of defect (execution state unplaced, derived gaps
self-warranting work) [Observed: REVIEW-01-KERNEL.md K-F1, K-F2]. This RFC
states the defaults explicitly so they can be accepted or rejected, not
inherited.

## 3. The contract

Clauses are numbered `RFC1-n` for stable citation. Amend in place; retire
rather than renumber. Parentheticals beginning
*History:* are amendment records — when and why text changed — and carry
no normative force; the clause text around them is the contract.

### 3.1 Project, repositories, governance root, consent

**RFC1-1.** A **Project** is one or more repositories with exactly one
designated **governance root** — the repository holding the Project's single
`openspec/**` and `.syzygy/**` plane — and one owner [Observed:
architecture.md, Definitions]. The kernel enforces "exactly one governance
root per Project" as an invariant: a project declaration naming zero or two
governance roots is a **contradiction** (§3.5), not a configuration to be
repaired silently. The two cases surface in different evaluation contexts.
**Two roots** is well-formed and evaluable: the declaration is readable, so
the contradiction is minted in the Project's own evaluation. **Zero roots**
is not — with no designated governance root there is no declared home to
read the project declaration from, no snapshot anchor for it, and therefore
no Project evaluation in which to mint anything. That case is surfaced at the
**workspace/manifest level**: a project whose declaration designates no
governance root is unevaluable as a Project and renders in the observing
workspace as Unknown (`missing-declaration`), with the contradiction minted
in the **workspace's own evaluation context** (RFC 0003's manifest
rendering — informative until RFC 0003 is accepted). It is never silently
repaired, and never rendered as an empty project [Inferred].

**RFC1-2.** **Repository** is one entity class carrying a declared **role**:
`governance-root` or `observed-source`. Governance root is a role, not a
separate entity — a second entity would split repository identity and the
consent record's subject. *(History: adjustment to SDR §4, which lists the two as
separate concepts: both remain V0-core; only the node count changes.)*
Repository identity is a declared identity in the project declaration,
never a remote URL or path — URLs and default branches change; identity
must not.

**RFC1-3.** Observed-source repositories are read-only to Syzygy unless
separately onboarded. Every observed repository — governance root or not —
requires a recorded **Consent record** (SEC-4). No consent means no
observation, and therefore **Unknown** — never an empty graph read as
absence. SEC-2's scoped egress consent (named providers, content classes)
is a **separate consent-record instance per (Project, provider)** — never
folded into a repository's observation consent (RFC3-7, RFC5-12 —
informative forward references, §5); absent
provider consent, the inferred layer renders Unknown rather than being
computed.

**RFC1-4.** A repository's role and membership are answered by the project
declaration; its content by the version-control authority through its typed
adapter. Two questions, two authorities (architecture.md, typed authority);
no kernel construct may merge them into one answer.

### 3.2 V0-core entities and extension profiles

**RFC1-5.** The **V0-core entity vocabulary is closed** at the following
classes. An entity not listed here enters the graph only through an
extension profile (RFC1-7) or an amendment to this RFC.

| Group | Entity | Identity minted by | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Governance / desired | Project | Owner, in the project declaration | RFC1-1 |
| | Repository (role: governance-root \| observed-source) | Project declaration | RFC1-2 |
| | Consent record | Owner (governance plane) | RFC1-3 |
| | Capability | Declaration act in the project's own governance/spec artifacts | §3.4; the map anchor |
| | Requirement reference · Scenario reference | The OpenSpec artifact contract (external authority) | Kernel holds references; content authority is `openspec/**` |
| | Decision (incl. dismissal) | Owner (governance plane) | A warrant, never evidence |
| | Policy | Governance plane | Incl. currency bounds and secret-detection policy |
| | Topology entry | Declared topology (governance plane) | Intended structure, distinct from observed code |
| | Declared region | Region declaration (governance plane) | Handcrafted/non-regeneratable carve-out; universally required Genome, may be empty |
| | Declared implementation mapping | Governance mapping artifact (SDR-4) | The primary declaration site of capability↔code edges |
| Temporal / epistemic | Source snapshot | Kernel (content-derived) | Closed identification of every deterministic input |
| | Evaluation | Kernel: (snapshot identity, as-of instant) — and nothing else | Incl. the **Reconciliation evaluation** kind (SDR-12); evaluation *kind* is descriptive and **never identity-bearing** (RFC2-3) |
| | Observation record | Kernel; identity derived from its evaluation identity + integrity digest | Immutable; a kind of Evidence; VIS-6 exception (b) |
| | Evidence artifact | The artifact's own source authority; identifier + integrity digest | Incl. the **Execution record** kind (SDR-8) — no new doctrine evidence class |
| | Claim | Kernel (derived, two-level — §3.5) | The only carrier of status |
| | Gap | Kernel (derived, two-level — §3.5) | V0 surfaces absence; V1 computes gaps |
| | Contradiction | Kernel (derived, two-level — §3.5): declared scope + canonically ordered durable identities of the cited claims | Owner-adjudicated only; RFC1-18(b) |
| | Challenge | The declared inference process, **or an attributed human via the governance plane** (RFC2-12); identity bound to one exact claim | V0 carries the admissibility floor only |
| Proposal / work | Proposal | Author (owner, agent, worker); the authority-scoped, collision-free scheme is a named **RFC 0003 obligation** (RFC1-9) | Kinds incl. **execution intent** (the plan item, §3.8) |
| | Materialization record | Kernel, at materialization: (proposal identity, work-item identity set, pinned warranted intent revision) | Immutable, one-way (SDR-7); the pinned revision is what RFC2-18's reconciliation evaluation and RFC4-19's warrant reference resolve (the RFC4-19 reference is informative, §5) |
| | Work item | Scheduler-issued, **mirrored never minted** | Reached only through the typed adapter |
| | Execution run | Toolchain-emitted run identity where one exists, else adapter-derived deterministically and labeled `derived` (RFC4-19 — informative, §5); + parent-run identity | Subagent runs are the same class with `part_of` |
| | Verification run | CI/test adapter; run identity + identity of the revision(s) under test (the run's claimed subject, RFC2-11) | Observed, not execution — §3.6 |
| Structure | Code element | Source adapter — adapter-defined, **not path-only** | Scheme is RFC 0004 material; the obligation (rename-stable enough for the link rule) is fixed here |
| | Observer/adapter identity | Syzygy: (adapter identity, version) | Versions are snapshot inputs |

**RFC1-6.** Two deliberate narrowings of the research catalog, recorded:

- **Doctrine artifacts and accepted contracts are not V0-core graph
  entities.** At V0 they are identified, evidence-linkable artifacts cited
  by their own stable identifiers (`VIS-n`, RFC numbers); doctrine already
  guarantees identifier stability, so no kernel-minted identity is needed
  [Inferred]. Claim-level nodes for them enter via the presentation
  profile if ever needed. *(SDR §4 omits both from V0-core; this clause
  makes the omission deliberate rather than accidental.)*
- **VCS objects (commits, refs) are not V0-core entities.** A commit SHA
  is a named evidence class [Observed: trust-and-evidence.md]; at V0
  commits enter the graph as Evidence artifacts referenced by
  materialization and verification. First-class VCS entities, if ever
  warranted, enter only through an amendment to this RFC informed by
  RFC 0004's findings — RFC 0004 itself declines to mint them; RFC1-5's
  closure is reopened by amendment here, never by delegation.

**RFC1-7.** **Extension profiles** are named, per-project-loadable entity
and relation sets, never presumed present: **inference** (inference
records, inferred implementation mappings, challenge machinery beyond the
admissibility floor), **presentation** (narrative composition; personal
view state is deliberately **not** reified even here — it stays outside
every state plane and is never a snapshot input, RFC1-22),
**map** (districts, scenes, lenses, layout records),
**portfolio** (workspace-manifest concerns per SDR-29/30; cross-project
relationship entities live here, and an undeclared cross-project relation
renders unconfirmed/asymmetric, never silently reconciled),
**annotation/dismissal** (designations, milestones, dismissal application
machinery). A profile may add vocabulary; it may never alter the semantics
of a V0-core clause. Profile contents are defined by RFCs 0002–0009.

**RFC1-8.** **Frozen-noun mapping.** Every doctrine-frozen noun resolves to
exactly one kernel construct: project, capability, gap, contradiction,
evidence, snapshot, evaluation, observation record → the entities above.
**Warrant** is deliberately not reified — it is a property of the
`motivates` edge or of a Decision, never a node. **Aligned** is realized as
the predicate of a Claim over (observed subject, cited normative reference,
evaluation) — resolving SDR §5 question 3; there is no `aligned` edge, so
every alignment stays challengeable (RFC1-24). **Converged** and
**genome-complete** are aggregate Claim predicates over a declared scope.
**Genome** is a membership predicate answered by the governance plane's
declared inventory, not an entity.

### 3.3 Identity: minting, continuity, split/merge/rename

**RFC1-9.** Every identity-bearing class names, in RFC1-5, exactly one
minting authority. The kernel **never mints an identity it does not own**:
work-item identities are mirrored from the scheduler; requirement identities
are held as references to the OpenSpec artifact contract; code-element
identities come from the source adapter. Kernel-owned identities (snapshot,
evaluation, claim, gap, contradiction, materialization record) are
**deterministically derived** from their defining inputs, so two runs over
the same inputs mint the same identity (VIS-7). **Author-minted identities**
(Proposal) are neither mirrored nor derived, so determinism protects them
from nothing: two authors — an agent and the owner, or two workers — could
otherwise mint colliding identifiers, and the materialization record,
`succeeds` citations of superseded proposals, and exclusivity groups all key
on this identity. The authority-scoped, collision-free **identity scheme for
Proposals is therefore delegated to RFC 0003 as a named obligation** — the
same delegation pattern used for code elements → RFC 0004 — because RFC 0003
already owns the `.syzygy/**` schema plane. This RFC fixes the obligation
(authority-scoped, collision-free, opaque per RFC1-10); the scheme is
RFC 0003 material.

**RFC1-10.** **Identifiers are opaque; names are labels.** For every
declared class (Capability, Topology entry, Declared region, Repository,
Project, Proposal): renaming the thing changes its label, never its
identifier. An identifier, once minted, is never reused and never
renumbered; retirement is terminal.

**RFC1-11.** **Split and merge mint successors, never mutations.** The
declaration act mints new identities and records `succeeds` edges from each
successor to its predecessor(s). The predecessor is retired, not deleted:
history and evidence referencing it must keep resolving (trust-floor link
rule). The kernel expresses the identity change to every surface as a
**rendered event, never a silent relocation** — a saved selection on a
retired identity resolves to the retirement record and its successors, not
to nothing and not silently to a successor.

**RFC1-12.** **Judgments do not silently survive identity change.** A
dismissal, challenge, or claim bound to a durable identity whose subject is
split or merged is **not** transferred to successors by the kernel: the
successor's claims and gaps are computed fresh, the predecessor's dismissal
renders as bound-to-retired-identity, and re-dismissal is an owner act.
[Inferred] This is the conservative reading of the temporal rule; an
automatic transfer would let a heuristic decide a governance question.

**RFC1-13.** Capability identity anchors map geography (architecture.md).
RFC 0009 (map contract) may rely on: identifier stability under rename,
successor edges under split/merge, and retirement as a rendered event.
Layout stability is downstream of this clause.

### 3.4 Capability, requirements, and the mapping to code

**RFC1-14.** **Capability** is the stable product-behavior identity: "a
named unit of declared behavior that the project's own spec or shape
documents assert exists, at the granularity a human would use to describe
what the project does" [Observed: architecture.md, Definitions]. Capability
identities come only from the project's own declared artifacts; a drafted
(unadopted) capability renders as unadopted and **may not anchor the map**
[Observed: v1.md]. Code mapping to no declared capability renders Unknown —
never silently inferred into a capability.

**RFC1-15.** **Requirement and Scenario are references, not owned content.**
The OpenSpec artifact contract is the external authority for their content
and identity; the kernel holds (artifact identity, anchor) references and
degrades to Unknown — never guesses — when a reference no longer resolves.
Whether OpenSpec identities survive edit and rename is [Unknown] and is an
RFC 0004 adapter-contract obligation; this RFC fixes only the kernel's
behavior when they do not.

**RFC1-16.** Capability↔code relationships are **four distinct classes,
never conflated** (SDR-3): (i) declared implementation mapping, (ii)
inferred implementation mapping, (iii) deterministically observed
structural relationships, (iv) requirement/scenario verification. A passing
test does not by itself prove semantic ownership. Class (i) lives in the
**Declared implementation mapping** governance artifact — the primary
declaration site (SDR-4); optional in-code markers may supplement, never
be required. Class (ii) enters only via the inference profile, challenge
authority only.

**RFC1-17.** A code element may carry declared mappings to **multiple
capabilities** (SDR-22). Aggregation and counting over such edges is
**identity-based**: one code element counted once per query subject, never
once per edge, and never forced into a single arbitrary capability district.

### 3.5 Claims, gaps, contradictions — two-level identity

**RFC1-18.** **Claim and Gap identity has two levels** (SDR-2):

- **Durable identity** — deterministically derived from (subject identity,
  cited normative reference identity, declared scope); the same identity
  across evaluations. Challenges and dismissals bind it: a dismissal
  recorded at one evaluation still binds the same gap at a later one.
- **Evaluation instance** — durable identity + evaluation identity,
  carrying status, epistemic label, rendering tier and Unknown reason where
  applicable (RFC2-24/25), supporting evidence set, freshness state, and
  challenge state. Determinism (VIS-7) binds the instance: one evaluation,
  one instance, identical across runs.

The durable derivation inherits every identity instability beneath it
(capability, requirement, code element); that inheritance is accepted and
is why RFC 0004's identity schemes are load-bearing.

**RFC1-18(a). Declared scope is a typed reference, never a string.** *(New
sub-clause of RFC1-18; the parent's durable derivation consumes it, as do
RFC2-15, RFC2-16 and RFC2-21.)* A **declared scope** is a canonically ordered
set — ascending by durable identifier, duplicates removed — drawn from the
declared identity-bearing entities of RFC1-5: Project, Capability, Topology
entry, Declared region. Declaring authority is one of exactly two:

- the **governance plane**, for standing scopes — a policy or decision
  artifact that names the member set; and
- the **recorded evaluation request**, for ad-hoc scopes.

Ad-hoc scopes are durable nonetheless, because the canonical form is
**content-derived**: the same member set is the same scope everywhere,
whoever requested it, so a dismissal or challenge recorded under one scope
rebinds under the identical scope later (SDR-2's whole point). A free-form
scope string is **not** a scope: it names no identified targets, so the
trust-floor link rule has nothing to resolve and two conforming
implementations would derive different durable identities for the same
aggregate claim [Inferred].

**RFC1-18(b). Contradiction identity, two levels.** *(History: new sub-clause;
deliberate adjustment — SDR-2 rules two-level identity for claims and gaps
only, and this extends the same treatment to Contradiction, which RFC1-25's
`scoped_to` row and RFC1-31 already assumed.)*

- **Durable identity** — deterministically derived from (declared scope per
  RFC1-18(a), the canonically ordered set of the **durable** identities —
  never evaluation instances — of the cited claims).
- **Evaluation instance** — durable identity + evaluation identity, carrying
  the rendering obligations of RFC1-21 at that evaluation.

**Membership drift** is an identity change, not a mutation: a changed cited
claim set mints a **new durable identity**, which must cite its predecessor
via `succeeds` — here in its **derived** form (RFC1-25), computed at the
evaluation that mints the successor and recorded inside that evaluation's
observation record, not the declared split/merge form of RFC1-11. An
`adjudicates` Decision binds **exactly the durable
identity it names** and no other, so a successor contradiction renders
**un-adjudicated with the predecessor's adjudication cited** — the
inheritance question is made visible to the owner as a question, never
carried over silently and never dropped silently. This is RFC1-12's
no-heuristic rule applied to adjudications.

**RFC1-19.** A **status claim** (anything that turns an indicator green,
declares aligned/converged/genome-complete, or asserts a gap factually
resolved or absent) requires current evidence; no evidence means Unknown,
never success (VIS-2). A narrative sentence doing a badge's work is judged
as a badge [Observed: trust-and-evidence.md].

**RFC1-20.** A gap leaves a surface in exactly two non-interchangeable
ways: **factual resolution/absence** (a status claim, evidence required)
or **policy dismissal** (a Decision with reason and expiry, rendered
*dismissed by decision*, never green). A dismissal without a reason
current at the evaluation's as-of instant renders the gap again — expiry
acts only through a new identified evaluation (VIS-6, exception (a)).

**RFC1-21.** A **Contradiction** (co-unsatisfiable authoritative claims in
one declared scope) renders the affected conclusion Unknown, routes to
owner adjudication, is never resolved by precedence, and is **never
auto-scheduled into work**. A **derived gap is not a work warrant**: it
motivates work only through a confirmation act — a Decision or a declared
deterministic Policy — because doctrine's warrant list admits a
*confirmed* finding and kernel-derived objects are not authorities
[Observed: trust-and-evidence.md, work warrant].

### 3.6 State planes and the act-assignment rule

**RFC1-22.** Every **source-state assertion** in the graph — an entity or
record that asserts project state on its own authority (a declaration, an
observation, a proposal, a challenge, a work item, a superseded record) —
is assigned to exactly one of six
**state planes**, always read at an identified evaluation. Plane
membership is a property of source-state assertions **only**: derived
objects and relation edges occupy no plane (see the closure paragraph
below, and RFC1-25's semantic relation classes). *(Reworded at the rev8
rework, item 4 — the earlier "every fact" phrasing collided with
RFC1-25's recorded edges; the model is two-dimensional: assertions carry
planes, relations carry semantic classes that cite plane inputs.)*

| Plane | Contents | Epistemic rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Desired** | Adopted governance and spec state: capabilities, requirement/scenario references, decisions, policies, topology entries, declared regions, declared implementation mappings, consent records, project/repository declarations | Only the owner adopts shape-level deltas (VIS-4) |
| **Proposed** | Unadopted deltas: Proposals, each with an exclusivity group | Never desired, never observed; may not anchor the map |
| **Observed** | What exists: code elements, evidence artifacts, observation records, verification runs | Deterministic, evidence-linked, immutable once recorded |
| **Inferred** | A layer, not a substrate: challenges (V0) and inference-profile artifacts | Challenge authority only; never establishes or raises a status; conservative suspension to Unknown |
| **Execution** | Work items, execution runs, materialization records, approved-unmaterialized execution intent (§3.8); Syzygy's own propagation acts, captured as Execution records (SDR-8) — no separate propagation entity is minted at V0 | **May never satisfy a desired-state claim** — work is never proof |
| **Historical** | The ordered series of superseded evaluations and their immutable observation records | Staleness visible on the primary surface; claims only degrade between evaluations over one snapshot |

Plane assignment is evaluated **per (assertion, evaluation)**, not once and
for
all: "exactly one plane" holds *at each evaluation*. **Supersession** moves an
observation record from **Observed** to **Historical** as a rendered
consequence of the superseding evaluation — the record itself is immutable
and is never edited; only its plane assignment at later evaluations changes,
and that move is rendered, never silent.

**The closure, stated so no implementation can disagree.** Derived objects
(snapshot, claim, gap, contradiction) occupy no plane: they identify or
compare planes. **Relation edges likewise occupy no plane** — an edge's
relationship to the planes is carried entirely by its **semantic relation
class** (RFC1-25), which names how an edge of that relation comes to exist
and which state-plane assertions it derives from. "Which plane is this
`cites` / `dismisses` / `adjudicates` edge on?" is a **category error**: a
conforming implementation must have no answer to it — neither a seventh
plane value nor a null that fails — because the question is only ever
lawfully asked of source-state assertions. Evaluations likewise occupy no
plane while current; their superseded series
is precisely what the Historical plane contains. Personal presentation state
sits outside every plane (VIS-6, exception (a)) and may never affect truth,
work, or status.

**RFC1-23.** **Act-assignment rule.** An act is **observed** when its
durable output is evidence about the *implementation* (a verification
run); it is **execution** when its durable output is evidence about the
*work* (an execution run, a propagation act). The rule is load-bearing,
not taxonomic: execution state never satisfies a desired-state claim, so
misclassifying an act moves its output into the plane that feeds status.
Corollaries: a verification run sits in the observed plane even when an
agent triggered it; "a worker reported tests passed" is Observed only as a
report fact — "tests passed" is Observed only when backed by a retained,
resolvable gate artifact (SDR-9).

### 3.7 Relation vocabulary — closed V0 set

**RFC1-24.** **All positive status flows through Claims.** No edge is
itself a status; evidence reaches status only via `supports` into a Claim,
and challenges attach only to Claims — so a status carried on any other
edge would be unchallengeable, defeating inference's only power. There is
no evidence-to-status backdoor.

**RFC1-25.** The V0 relation vocabulary is **closed** at the following set.
Each relation is typed (domain → range) and carries a **semantic relation
class** — never a plane of its own (RFC1-22's closure). The semantic class
names two things at once: **how an edge of that relation comes to exist**
(declared by a governance act, recorded by an observation, computed by the
kernel, minted by a Decision) and **which state-plane assertions it derives
from**. The class vocabulary is closed at the values the table uses,
read as follows *(History: restated at the rev8 rework, item 4)*:

- **Desired / Desired (declared)** — derives from a Desired-plane
  declaration or adoption act;
- **Proposed** — derives from a Proposal;
- **Observed** — recorded inside an identified observation record,
  deriving from Observed-plane assertions; an edge instance of this class
  is a fact only when so recorded;
- **Inferred** — minted by the inference layer; challenge authority only;
- **Execution** — derives from Execution-plane records
  (scheduler-authoritative);
- **Derived** — computed by the kernel from other graph objects at an
  evaluation; a fact only when recorded inside an identified observation
  record;
- **Governance act** — minted by a recorded owner Decision;
- **Declared … or inferred** (composite) — two queryably distinct
  derivation sources, disclosed per edge;
- **Desired → execution** (the plane-crossing warrant form, `motivates`
  only) — a Desired-plane warrant licensing Execution-plane work; the
  class names the crossing because neither endpoint's plane describes the
  edge;
- **Varies by endpoint / Matches endpoint / Follows the containing
  authority** — resolution rules, not classes: each resolves to one of the
  above per (relation, endpoint pair) as RFC1-25(d) fixes.

| Relation | Domain → Range | Semantic class | Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `contains` / `part_of` | Project→Repository (declared); Repository→Code element (observed); Requirement ref→Scenario ref; Capability→Capability; Topology→Topology; Execution run→Execution run | Follows the containing authority | Only within one authority's own hierarchy; cross-authority nesting must use a typed relation |
| `declares` | Governance/spec artifact → Capability · Topology entry · Declared region · Declared implementation mapping · Repository role | Desired | The identity-minting edge; a drafted declaration may not anchor the map |
| `refines` | Requirement ref→Capability; Capability→Capability | Desired | Both endpoints adopted |
| `governs` | Policy → Claim classes, evaluations, observation behavior | Desired | A draft governs nothing |
| `motivates` | Requirement ref · Decision · Policy → Work item · Proposal; **Gap → only through a confirmation act** | Desired → execution (the work-warrant edge) | Carries doctrine's four warrant classes, verbatim and closed: {approved requirement/intent, **confirmed** finding, declared policy, explicit owner decision} [Observed: trust-and-evidence.md, "a work warrant"]. Every finding-class warrant requires a **recorded confirmation act** — a derived or inferred finding warrants nothing until confirmed (RFC1-21). SDR-1 is cited here only for the absence of a Feature warrant class (RFC1-32) |
| `implements` | Code element → Capability · Requirement ref | Declared (via mapping artifact) **or** inferred (profile; challenge-only) | The two sources are queryably distinct (SDR-3 i/ii); multi-capability edges permitted with identity-based counting (SDR-22) |
| `structurally_related` (`calls`, `exposes`, `accesses(mode)`) | Code element → Code element | Observed | SDR-3 class (iii); adapter and version identified in the snapshot |
| `realizes` | Code element → Topology entry | Declared or inferred, labelled | Intended-vs-observed structure delta is a gap/contradiction source |
| `covers` | Declared region → Code element | Desired (declared) | Authoritative for *which* region is Genome; never evidence the covered code exists — absent code renders Unknown |
| `verifies` | Code element (test) · Verification run → Requirement ref · Scenario ref · Capability | Observed | SDR-3 class (iv). An input a Claim cites, **never a status itself**; requires an identified deterministic input, read per endpoint — the source snapshot for a Code element (test) edge, the identity of the revision(s) under test for a Verification run edge (RFC1-5; RFC2-11's evidence–revision binding). An external run naming a revision Syzygy did not snapshot still qualifies; it renders stale for any snapshot whose revision differs |
| `depends_on` | Work item→Work item (execution, scheduler-authoritative); Code element→Code element (observed) | Varies by endpoint | Each endpoint cites its own authority. **Four senses must not be conflated, not two** — see the anti-conflation invariant at RFC1-25(b) and the typed relation identity that carries the separation at RFC1-25(d). This relation carries exactly the two endpoint pairs above and admits no third; the portfolio profile's Project→Project `depends-on` (RFC1-7; RFC3-14) and the declared architectural `declared-dependency` below are separate relations, not further endpoint pairs of this one. Adding one would be the re-typing RFC1-26 forbids |
| `declared-dependency` | Capability→Capability; Topology entry→Topology entry | **Desired (declared)** | *Minted by A6.* The declared architectural dependency: a statement that one capability or topology entry is **intended** to depend on another. Owner-adopted via a governance artifact (`declares`); never derived, never inferred, never promoted from an observed or execution edge. It is the declared side of an intended-vs-observed dependency delta, and a divergence between it and the observed `depends_on` (Code element endpoint) is a gap or contradiction source, exactly as `realizes` is for structure. Absence of a declared edge is never evidence that no dependency exists — an undeclared dependency renders Unknown, reason #1 |
| `placed_in` | Topology entry → Capability | **Desired (declared)** | *Minted by A7.* The cross-hierarchy placement edge. `contains`/`part_of` is confined to a single authority's own hierarchy and its rule requires a typed relation for cross-authority nesting; this is that relation. Minted by a governance artifact (`declares`), never by a renderer or a layout algorithm — an undeclared placement decided by an algorithm is a governance answer given by a renderer (RFC9-20). It is the declared basis for the component-block level (RFC9-4) and for district membership including shared infrastructure (RFC9-19(b)); an entry with no `placed_in` edge renders in the unmapped district (RFC9-44), never in a guessed one |
| `proposes_change_to` | Proposal → any desired or observed entity | Proposed | Carries the exclusivity group (RFC1-27); never upgrades without adoption |
| `materializes` | Materialization record: Proposal (execution intent) → Work item set | Execution | Immutable, one-way (SDR-7); commits enter as evidence, not edges, at V0 |
| `addresses` | Work item → Gap | Execution | *Addresses*, never *closes* — gap exit is RFC1-20 only |
| `supports` | Evidence artifact (incl. observation record) → Claim | Observed | The **only** path from evidence to positive status |
| `challenges` | Challenge → Claim | Inferred | Admissibility floor: one exact claim, falsifiable concern, provenance, individually resolvable; an open **admitted** challenge suspends to Unknown with the deterministic basis visible (lifecycle: RFC2-13 — submitted or rejected challenges suspend nothing) |
| `dismisses` | Decision → Gap (durable identity) | Governance act | Reason + expiry mandatory; rendered *dismissed by decision*, never green |
| `adjudicates` | Decision → Contradiction | Governance act | The only lawful contradiction exit |
| `cites` | Claim → Requirement ref · Scenario ref · Capability · Policy · Declared region · Topology entry | Derived | Every status claim names its normative basis |
| `scoped_to` | Claim/Gap/Contradiction instance → Evaluation | Derived | A status without an evaluation is not a status |
| `produced_by` | Evidence → Verification run · Execution run; Observation record → Evaluation | Observed | The provenance backbone |
| `identified_in` | Adapter identity · Policy · Repository state · consumed reports → Source snapshot | Derived | Snapshot closure: an uncaptured source must not influence deterministic claims |
| `supersedes` | Same-class pairs only: for each identity-bearing class whose RFC1-31 lifecycle mints successive versions or superseding records, exactly the pair (that class → prior version of the same class); no cross-class pair exists | Matches endpoint | Version-level only; never supersedes an identifier. Pair set closed by RFC1-31: a class either versions there or does not; each (C → C) pair resolves per RFC1-25(d) to the superseding endpoint's own assertion class |
| `succeeds` | Successor identity → predecessor identity | Desired (declared) for declared classes; **derived** for Contradiction successors (RFC1-18(b)), recorded inside the minting evaluation's observation record | The split/merge continuity edge (RFC1-11); the same relation carries contradiction membership drift, where no declaration act exists to carry it |

**RFC1-25(a) — Two relations minted by owner decision.** `declared-dependency`
(A6) and `placed_in` (A7) are additions to this closed vocabulary made by
explicit owner decision at acceptance, not by a drafter. Both are
Desired/declared and both are minted only through `declares`. RFC1-26's
closure is amended to include them and otherwise stands unchanged: this is an
amendment to a closed list, which the closure permits, and **not** a re-typing
of an existing relation, which it forbids.

**RFC1-25(b) — The dependency anti-conflation invariant.** Four relations in
this project carry a dependency sense, and **two of them differ by one
character**: the core `depends_on` (underscore) and the portfolio profile's
`depends-on` (hyphen, RFC3-14). The owner chose the hyphenated spelling
deliberately at acceptance, having been shown the collision. **The names
therefore do not separate these senses, and the separation is carried entirely
by this invariant, which is normative and mechanically checkable:**

| Sense | Relation | Semantic class | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Work dependency | `depends_on` (Work item→Work item) | Execution | Scheduler |
| Code dependency | `depends_on` (Code element→Code element) | Observed | Adapter + snapshot |
| Architectural dependency | `declared-dependency` | Desired (declared) | Governance artifact |
| Project dependency | `depends-on` (Project→Project, profile) | Desired (declared) | Owner-adopted manifest |

**No edge of any one sense is ever evidence of any other**, in either
direction, at any strength. The checkable form, which every conforming
implementation must be able to demonstrate and which is a named test-coverage
obligation of the first implementation slice: **for each ordered pair of the
four senses, an edge of the first must not cause an edge of the second to be
emitted, counted, rendered, or served** — twelve ordered pairs, each
separately testable. A surface that unions any two of these into one
"dependencies" count violates this clause even if the union is labelled;
disclosure does not cure conflation here, because the four have different
semantic classes — different plane derivations — and therefore different
truth conditions. [Inferred — the
invariant follows from the four semantic classes; it was made a checkable
twelve-pair rule after the owner's spelling decision (B20).]

**RFC1-25(c) — Cardinality of `placed_in`.** *(History: added after review 8, finding
ML-R8 — see the review dispositions.)*

`placed_in` is **not functional**: the kernel accepts more than one adopted
`placed_in` edge from a single topology entry, because the kernel records what
is declared and a governance artifact is fully capable of declaring two homes.
The relation carries **no primacy marker** — there is no "primary" `placed_in`,
and no ordering, timestamp, or lexical property of an edge confers one.

Two or more adopted `placed_in` edges from one entry are therefore a
**declared placement contradiction** (RFC1-21/RFC2-15), not a precedence
problem. The kernel holds all of them, marks the contradiction, and surfaces
the adjudication route; no consumer may select among them. Adjudication is a
governance act — retracting or amending a declaration — and never a read-time
choice. **A surface that picks a home among competing `placed_in` edges by any
rule whatsoever has given a governance answer** (RFC9-20), and a surface that
picks *differently* from another conforming surface breaks RFC6-22/23
equivalence on the entity's location, on every district composition count it
enters, and on whether an adjudication is outstanding.

Zero `placed_in` edges is likewise not an error and not a contradiction: the
entry is simply unplaced, and renders Unknown with `missing-declaration`
(RFC 0009's unmapped district, RFC9-44). [Inferred — the existing
Desired-plane contradiction rule applied to a newer relation; only the
non-functionality and no-primacy statements are new.]

**RFC1-25(d) — Typed relation identity: the spelling is never the
identity.** *(History: added at the rev7 rework — directive item B5 of
`_bootstrap/rfc-phase/REV7-REWORK-DIRECTIVE.md`, not owner decision B5 —
completing RFC1-25(b): the
twelve-pair invariant said the senses must not conflate, but left their
*identity* carried by display spellings that differ by one character or not
at all. Reworked at rev7 review 9, finding S3.)*

**What a typed relation is.** A **typed relation** is one (relation name,
ordered endpoint-domain pair) combination from the RFC1-25 table: each row
contributes one typed relation **per endpoint pair it lists**. `depends_on`
therefore names **two** typed relations (Work item→Work item;
Code element→Code element), `contains`/`part_of` names six, and a
single-pair row names exactly one. The table — read this way — **is** the
enumeration of V0 typed relations; no separate list exists to drift from
it. Deriving these identities from what the table already declares neither
adds a relation nor re-types one, so RFC1-26's closure stands exactly as
written: the typed-relation set is closed *because* the rows and their
endpoint pairs are closed, and widening either still requires an owner
decision.

**Identity and metadata.** Each typed relation's identity is a **stable
typed relation identifier**, never its display spelling. The identifier is
a governed value distinct from the label, and every typed relation carries
as explicit metadata its **ordered endpoint domains** (domain → range
entity kinds) and its **semantic relation class** (RFC1-25's closed class
vocabulary, restated there at the rev8 rework). The class is the RFC1-25
table's value **resolved per endpoint pair** — per-pair resolution is what
discharges the table's "Varies by endpoint,"
"Matches endpoint," and "Follows the containing authority" entries into a
single class per typed relation. A semantic class is **not** a state
plane and no edge occupies one (RFC1-22's closure):
recording any class value — `Derived`, `Governance act`, `Observed` — as a
plane assignment would
break that closure; the class
vocabulary is its own closed set naming derivation, and machine answers
carry it as a class,
never as a plane. Binding consequences:

- **Storage, APIs, query answers, fixtures, and tests reference the typed
  identifier**, never a parsed label: no conforming implementation may
  determine which sense an edge carries by inspecting the spelling
  `depends_on` vs `depends-on`, by guessing from endpoint kinds at read
  time, or by any other label-derived rule.
- **Display labels are derived from identity**, one-way: the owner's chosen
  spellings (`depends_on` for the work and code senses, `depends-on` for
  the portfolio sense, `declared-dependency` for the architectural sense —
  B20) remain exactly as chosen, as *renderings* of the typed identity.
  Two typed relations may lawfully share a spelling because the spelling
  carries no identity; nothing may lawfully share an identifier.
- **Anti-conflation fixtures are required for every ordered pairing** of
  the four dependency-sense typed relations of RFC1-25(b) — the twelve
  ordered pairs, each exercised by a fixture in which an edge of the first
  typed relation exists and the test asserts no edge, count, rendering, or
  answer of the second appears. This is part of the same named
  first-implementation-slice test obligation RFC1-25(b) carries.
- The identifier scheme's concrete syntax is an implementation-slice
  choice; this clause binds only that identifiers exist, are stable, are
  distinct per typed relation, and carry the two metadata dimensions
  above.

[Inferred — the mechanism; Observed — the four senses, their state
classes, and the owner's spelling decision from RFC1-25(b)/B20; the
per-pair reading of the table and the plane/class distinction from
RFC1-22's closure.]

**RFC1-26.** Every rendered internal edge must resolve to its identified
target (trust floor); an edge the kernel cannot resolve is not emitted.
Relations not in this table do not exist at V0; profiles may add relations
under their governing RFCs but may not re-type these. **A relation may be
added to this table only by amendment carrying an owner decision** (RFC1-25(a)
records the two such amendments to date); no drafter, reviewer, adapter, or
profile may widen the core vocabulary by prose.

### 3.8 Proposals, exclusivity groups, and the approved plan item

**RFC1-27.** A **Proposal** is the single entity for every unadopted delta.
Kinds: (a) governance delta (doctrine/contract/topology), (b) spec delta,
(c) code change set, (d) generated code-shaped artifact, (e) **execution
intent** — a proposed, decomposable set of work to be performed. Every
proposal declares an **exclusivity group**; the kernel refuses to render a
projection that unions two proposals in one group, and refuses to silently
union proposals whose compatibility is undeclared — the honest render is
*N candidate futures*, selectable one at a time (VIS-1). Competing
proposals over one subject never collapse into a fictitious consensus.

**RFC1-28.** **The approved-but-unmaterialized plan item is a lifecycle
state of the Proposal entity** — resolving SDR §5 question 1. A Proposal of
kind *execution intent*, once approved through its adoption gate, enters
state `approved` and resides under `.syzygy/work/**`, which owns approved
execution intent before materialization (SDR-7). Same entity, same
identity; approval adds the approving Decision and mints nothing new. It
sits in the **execution plane** (intent about work, not a behavioral claim
about the system) and is therefore barred by RFC1-22 from ever satisfying
a desired-state claim.

**RFC1-29.** **Materialization is a one-way door.** Materializing an
approved execution-intent Proposal creates an immutable **Materialization
record** mapping the proposal identity to the scheduler-issued work-item
identities **and pinning the exact intent revision — requirement, scenario,
or governance clause version — cited by the proposal's warrant** (SDR-7);
the pinned revision is the one RFC2-18's reconciliation evaluation binds its
verdict to. From that instant the scheduler is authoritative for
work lifecycle state, the proposal transitions to terminal state
`materialized`, and the kernel never edits it again — divergence between
record and later scheduler state is a fact about the scheduler, never
grounds to rewrite history. At every instant exactly one authority answers
"what is the state of this planned work": before materialization the
approved Proposal, after it the scheduler through its typed adapter — the
second-source prohibition is honored by *sequencing* authority, not
duplicating it.

**The written materialization record is constitutive.** Materialization is a
distributed act — the scheduler issues work-item identities before the record
can name them — so the transition instant is fixed at the record, not at the
issuance: **until the record exists, materialization has not occurred**, and
the approved Proposal remains the sole authority for the state of the planned
work, whatever the scheduler already holds. Scheduler work items matching no
materialization record are an **orphaned-work contradiction** (§3.5) — two
stores answering one question, no pinned intent revision for RFC2-18 to bind
to, no warrant traceable through `materializes` — routed to owner
adjudication and **rendered**, never silently adopted into a record, never
silently deleted, and never read as evidence that materialization happened.
Re-materialization after a partial failure must **cite and supersede the
orphan finding** in the new materialization record, so a retry is traceable
rather than a second silent attempt; violation case 10 (one plan item
materialized twice) is unchanged [Inferred].

**RFC1-30.** An approved execution-intent Proposal may be decomposed into
child execution-intent Proposals (`part_of`), each individually
materializable under the parent's warrant. Decomposition is authorship,
not adoption: children inherit the parent's approval only if the approving
Decision says so; otherwise they gate separately.

### 3.9 Entity lifecycle

**RFC1-31.** Canonical lifecycles, per class group:

- **Declared classes** (Capability, Topology entry, Declared region,
  Declared implementation mapping): drafted (unadopted; may not anchor
  status or the map) → adopted → amended in place (same identifier) →
  split/merged via successors (RFC1-11) → retired (terminal).
- **Governance acts** (Decision, Consent record, Policy): recorded/granted
  → in force → expired/narrowed/revoked/superseded — always evaluated at
  the as-of instant, never by ambient wall clock.
- **Observed classes** (Code element, Evidence, Observation record):
  appear in a snapshot → observed across evaluations → absent in a later
  snapshot (absence is a fact, not a deletion); observation records are
  immutable and become historical when superseded, staleness rendered.
- **Proposals**: drafted → under review → approved (kind (e): then
  `approved` → `materialized`, RFC1-28/29) / adopted (kinds (a),(b)) /
  rejected / abandoned / superseded. Kinds (c) *code change set* and (d)
  *generated code-shaped artifact* terminate by being **cited as inputs of a
  kind-(e) execution-intent proposal** — terminal state `incorporated`,
  recording the citing proposal — or else rejected / abandoned / superseded.
  Their contents reach code no other way: only materialized execution intent
  is worked, so an implementation may not auto-wrap or adopt-as-artifact its
  way around the gate (VIS-5). Rejection, abandonment, and
  supersession are reachable **only before materialization** —
  `materialized` is terminal (RFC1-29), and superseding a materialized
  proposal would recreate the second editable store; post-materialization
  regret is expressed as a *new* proposal citing the old one.
- **Work items**: lifecycle owned by the scheduler, mirrored with labeled
  staleness when the adapter degrades — never invisibly.
- **Derived classes** (Claim, Gap, Contradiction): computed at an
  evaluation; instance statuses degrade or are recomputed per the temporal
  rule; durable identities persist across evaluations (RFC1-18 for Claim and
  Gap, RFC1-18(b) for Contradiction) and end only when their subject or
  normative basis is retired (RFC1-12) — or, for a Contradiction, when its
  cited claim set drifts and mints a successor (RFC1-18(b)).

### 3.10 No Feature entity

**RFC1-32.** There is **no Feature kernel entity and no Feature identity**
(SDR-1). Capability is the sole stable product-behavior identity.
"Feature" and "feature request" live as **workflow vocabulary**: the
warrant class *approved intent* on the `motivates` edge, and intake-flow
naming in the work surface's own contract (RFC 0008). UI prose may say
"feature" only where it resolves to a Capability identity; no surface,
adapter, or profile may mint a feature identifier.

---

## 4. Violation cases

One or more per clause group; each is recognizable, not rhetorical:

1. *(RFC1-1/3)* A declaration lists two governance roots and the kernel
   picks the first — must be a contradiction routed to the owner; likewise
   rendering any graph content for a repository with no consent record.
2. *(RFC1-5/6)* An implementation adds a `Commit` node type "because the
   adapter had the data" — V0-core is closed; commits are evidence at V0.
3. *(RFC1-10/11)* A capability rename mints a new identifier and the map
   relocates; or a split silently reassigns the old identifier to the
   larger fragment.
4. *(RFC1-12)* After a split, an in-force gap dismissal on the predecessor
   is auto-copied to both successors.
5. *(RFC1-14/16)* Unmapped code colored by its nearest capability's
   status; or a passing test treated as proof of semantic ownership.
6. *(RFC1-18/20)* Re-evaluation orphans an open challenge because claims
   are identified per-evaluation only; or a dismissed gap renders green.
7. *(RFC1-22/23)* A completed work item flips a requirement's alignment
   indicator; or a worker's self-reported "tests passed" enters the
   observed plane without a retained gate artifact.
8. *(RFC1-24/25)* A `verifies` edge rendered as a green badge with no
   Claim behind it — an unchallengeable status.
9. *(RFC1-27)* Two proposals in one exclusivity group rendered as one
   merged future scene — comprehensible fiction.
10. *(RFC1-28/29)* An approved plan item edited in `.syzygy/work/**` after
    its materialization record exists; or one plan item materialized twice.
11. *(RFC1-32)* A surface stores `feature_id` alongside capability
    identities.

---

## 5. Integration

**RFCs 0002–0009 may rely on:** the closed V0-core entity and relation
vocabulary and its clause numbers; identity minting authorities and
continuity rules (rename/split/merge/retire); two-level claim/gap
identity; the six state planes and the act-assignment rule;
all-status-through-claims (RFC1-24); exclusivity-group semantics; the
plan-item resolution (RFC1-28/29); capability as the sole behavior
identity with no feature tier.

**Left to them:** **0002** — Unknown-reason vocabulary, rendering-tier
registry (report-fact vs gate-backed, declared-only), currency bounds per
claim class, challenge lifecycle beyond the admissibility floor. **0003**
— `project.yaml` and `.syzygy/**` schemas, versioning, identity-preserving
migration. **0004** — concrete identity schemes for code elements,
OpenSpec reference stability, adapter version registry, run envelope,
reduced-fidelity labeling (SDR-31/33), first-class VCS entities if needed.
**0005** — authentication, execution profiles (SEC-3). **0006** —
selection/URL/query semantics and the single evidence drawer over this
RFC's entity references. **0007–0009** — surface contracts (narrative
model, work ontology incl. "feature request" intake vocabulary, map
geography/lens grammar over capability identities). Certificate semantics
remain post-V1.

**Forward references are informative.** Where a clause of this RFC cites a
sibling *draft* by clause number (RFC3-n, RFC4-n, RFC5-n — e.g. RFC1-3's
consent split, RFC1-5's run-identity and warrant-reference notes, RFC1-9's
Proposal-scheme delegation, RFC1-1's workspace surfacing path), the citation
is **informative until that RFC is accepted**: it names where the obligation
will be discharged, not a dependency of this contract's meaning. The kernel
text is self-standing without them, and a renumbering in a sibling draft
changes nothing here. Only citations to **adopted doctrine** and to the
**SDR** are load-bearing.

---

## 6. Alternatives considered

### 6.1 The approved-but-unmaterialized plan item (the SDR §5 q1 options)

- **(i) Dedicated pre-materialization plan-item entity.** Rejected. Its
  content — what to do, why, under whose approval, exclusive with what —
  duplicates the Proposal machinery (identity, review, adoption gate,
  exclusivity group) node for node: a second store of "what we intend to
  do," the exact merge-rejectable class the research corpus's
  non-duplication test names, and a standing lockstep-drift risk with no
  offsetting semantic gain. [Inferred]
- **(ii) Approved plan as a kind/state of Proposal — chosen (RFC1-28).**
  Honors the second-source prohibition by sequencing authority instead of
  duplicating it: one entity, one identity, one authority for its state at
  every instant (`.syzygy/work/**` before the materialization record, the
  scheduler after — exactly SDR-7's split). Approval act, exclusivity
  group, and provenance chain come free from machinery already required.
- **(iii) Scheduler-native epic fallback.** Rejected. It contradicts
  SDR-7 (the scheduler owns lifecycle only *after* materialization); it
  moves approved-but-unexecuted intent into an external authority reached
  only through an adapter, so approval state would live outside the
  governed plane and be lost at offboarding; and it makes the owner's
  approval act invisible to VIS-6 rebuildability.

### 6.2 Other roads not taken

- **Governance root as its own entity** (SDR §4's literal listing) — made
  a Repository role instead (RFC1-2): a second entity splits repository
  identity and the consent subject.
- **Aligned as a first-class edge** — rejected for the Claim predicate
  (RFC1-8): a bare edge is unchallengeable and unscoped.
- **Doctrine-claim and Contract kernel entities at V0** — deferred to the
  presentation profile (RFC1-6); SDR §4 omits them.
- **Automatic judgment transfer across splits/merges** — rejected
  (RFC1-12); a heuristic would silently decide a governance question.
- **Per-evaluation-only claim identity** — rejected by SDR-2; it orphans
  challenges and dismissals at every re-evaluation.

---

## 7. Deliberately deferred

Concrete identity-scheme syntax for code elements and the OpenSpec
reference stability guarantee → RFC 0004 (obligations fixed here; schemes
are adapter contracts). Snapshot representation (one tuple vs composite) →
RFC 0003/0004; the closure rule is fixed here. Gap *computation* (V1) — V0
surfaces absence; the entities are defined now so both share one identity.
Challenge machinery beyond the admissibility floor, and inference records
→ inference profile / RFC 0002. Cross-project relationship semantics →
portfolio profile (SDR-30). Convergence certificate semantics → post-V1
RFC (future-tagged). The confirmation-path enumeration behind RFC1-21
(which acts confirm a gap into a work warrant) → RFC 0002/0008.

---

## 8. Open questions for acceptance

Genuine owner-visible choices only; everything else in this RFC is decided
above and challengeable through review.

1. **RFC1-12 (judgment lapse on split/merge).** The conservative default —
   dismissals and challenges do not transfer to successors — costs the
   owner re-dismissal work after refactors of declared structure. The
   alternative (transfer only where the split declaration explicitly maps
   predecessor judgments to successors) is doctrine-compatible but adds a
   declaration burden at split time. Accept the default, or require the
   explicit-mapping option?
2. **RFC1-6 (no doctrine-claim/contract kernel entities at V0).** Follows
   SDR §4's omission, but means V0 claims cannot cite an individual
   VIS-rule as a graph node — only requirements, capabilities, policies,
   regions, and topology entries. Confirm the narrowing, or direct that a
   thin normative-artifact reference entity be added to V0-core.
3. **RFC1-30 (decomposition approval inheritance).** Children of an
   approved execution-intent Proposal gate separately unless the approving
   Decision says otherwise. Confirm this default (safer, more owner
   touches) versus inherit-by-default (fewer touches, larger blast radius
   per approval).
4. **RFC1-18(b) (two-level identity extended to Contradiction).** SDR-2
   scopes durable-plus-instance identity to **claims and gaps**; RFC1-18(b)
   extends the same treatment to Contradiction so that a changed cited-claim
   set mints a new durable identity citing its predecessor, and a successor
   renders **un-adjudicated with the predecessor's adjudication cited**
   rather than silently inheriting it. This is a deliberate extension of an
   owner ruling, taken because the alternative — no durable contradiction
   identity — makes an `adjudicates` Decision either unbindable or silently
   carried across a membership change, and RFC1-12 forbids the heuristic
   that silent carry-over would require. Confirm the extension, or rule that
   Contradiction stays instance-only and adjudication is re-requested on
   every membership change. *(A consequence the owner should see: this also
   gave RFC1-25's `succeeds` relation a derived form for Contradiction
   successors, since no declaration act exists to carry that edge — the
   relation was previously Desired/declared only.)*

   > **ANSWERED at acceptance — B3.** **Extended.** Durable identity = (declared scope, canonically ordered set of the cited claims' durable identities); a changed set mints a new durable identity citing its predecessor via `succeeds`. An adjudication binds exactly the identity it named, so a **successor renders un-adjudicated with the predecessor's adjudication cited** — a visible inheritance question, never a silent carry-over. The re-adjudication tax is accepted deliberately.
5. **RFC1-2 (governance root as a Repository role, not its own entity).**
   Surfaced here for the same reason as q4, and sized honestly: it is the
   *other* place this RFC adjusts owner-ratified text, and leaving one
   surfaced and one inline is an asymmetry this section should not carry.
   SDR §4 lists Repository and governance root as **two separate concepts**;
   RFC1-2 collapses the second into a declared **role** on the first, so
   V0-core has one node class where the SDR's listing implies two. **Why:** a
   second entity splits repository identity from the consent record's subject
   (RFC3-7 makes the consent subject a repository), and a split subject is how
   a repository ends up consented in one identity and observed in another.
   **What actually changes:** only the node count — both concepts remain
   V0-core, the role is declared and rendered, and no rule elsewhere in this
   RFC depends on the collapse. **The alternative** is to restore governance
   root as its own entity and give it its own identity, accepting the split
   consent subject and a `governs`-style edge to the repository. Confirm the
   collapse, or restore the SDR's literal two?

   > **ANSWERED at acceptance — B22.** The **substance stands** (governance root is a Repository role), and the **process is corrected**: any future divergence from owner-ratified text is a surfaced item, never an inline note. The asymmetry — one divergence surfaced, its sibling recorded inline — was the defect, in a section that promises genuine owner-visible choices only.
6. **A declared dependency relation (RFC1-25/RFC1-26) — the third side of a
   decision already before you.** RFC1-25 closes `depends_on` to two endpoint
   pairs, both non-declared: observed code→code and execution-class work→work.
   The portfolio profile then declares a Project→Project dependency
   (RFC 0003's `depends-on`, RFC3-14) which is **Desired/declared** — a
   third state class, at a fourth endpoint pair, lawful under RFC1-7 but
   outside this table. It was renamed post-draft away from `depends-on`
   precisely so no reader takes it for this relation, and RFC1-25's
   anti-conflation rule was widened to cover all three senses. **What is still
   the owner's:** whether a *declared* dependency relation belongs in the
   kernel vocabulary at all, or stays a profile relation. It is put here
   rather than in RFC 0003 because the subject is this table's closure, not
   the plane's shape. **A consequence worth seeing:** RFC9-9 rests part of its
   legend rule on there being no declared dependency relation at V0 — true of
   capabilities, topology entries and code elements, which is what it says,
   but no longer the whole picture now that a declared dependency exists at
   *project* scope. If a kernel-level declared relation is directed, RFC9-9's
   legend and edge-channel rules need a corresponding pass. **Note this is one
   decision seen from three sides:** RFC 0003 §7 defers the cross-project
   relation *type vocabulary* to a portfolio-profile RFC, RFC 0009 §8 q5
   reports the missing declared relation as a foundation defect, and this question
   asks whether the kernel should carry one.

   > **ANSWERED at acceptance — A6.** Yes: `declared-dependency` (Capability→Capability, Topology entry→Topology entry, Desired/declared) is **minted in the core vocabulary** by owner amendment — see RFC1-25 and RFC1-25(a). Separately A7 mints `placed_in`, and B20 reverted the portfolio relation's name to `depends-on`; RFC1-25(b) carries the resulting four-sense checkable invariant.

*End of RFC 0001. Clauses RFC1-1 … RFC1-32, plus sub-clauses RFC1-18(a)
(declared scope), RFC1-18(b) (contradiction identity), and RFC1-25(a)–(d)
(owner-minted relations, the dependency anti-conflation invariant, `placed_in`
cardinality, typed relation identity). The clause range is closed; amendments
change text in place or add lettered sub-clauses, never renumber.*
