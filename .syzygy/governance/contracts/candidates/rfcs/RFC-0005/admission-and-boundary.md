title: Admission and the Syzygy Boundary — principals, client classes, credentials, exposure, audit
status_source: owner-act-record
module: admission-and-boundary
clauses: RFC5-1..RFC5-11, RFC5-24..RFC5-26 (no gaps within either run, no retirements, no merges)
governs: [principals, sessions, machine-credentials, client-classes, exposure-modes, adapter-credentials, audit, revocation]
applies_to: [kernel, all-surfaces, machine-clients]
depends_on: [RFC-0001, RFC-0002, RFC-0003]
tags: [sec-1, sec-4, sec-5, vis-5, client-classes, acts-versus-claims, audit-trail, a1-correlation]
---

**Status:** Proposed foundational contract (self-declaration at authoring
time). Effective status is established solely by an owner-act record binding
this file's exact content digest — as an owner-adopted bootstrap act until the
independent A1 correlation mechanism exists, and as a Syzygy-verified effective
act only after correlation (RFC3-16). Absent such a record, this contract binds
nothing.

**Package:** module 1 of 3 of the RFC 0005 contract package. Index, clause map,
lookup rule, package-spanning integration and the package question list:
`README.md`. Rationale, amendment history, alternatives, and answered §8
questions: `../../history/RFC-0005-history.md`.

**Serves:** SEC-1, SEC-4, SEC-5; VIS-5 (adapter authorization); VIS-7/trust
floor. Implements SDR §5 q8's machine-client half and owner decisions **B9**
(session identity is the credential and nothing else), **B4** (revocation forces
an evaluation), and **A1** (where the audit trail lives). Grounded in FD-009
(LAN posture) and OQ-007.

## 0. Module scope and reader map (non-normative)

*If this section and a clause disagree, the clause wins.*

This module owns **who may talk to Syzygy at all, and how every act at that
boundary is attributed and revoked**. Read it to answer: *may this request in?*
The other two modules presuppose it — an egress check (module 2) or an execution
launch (module 3) is performed *for* an admitted principal, and both emit into
the audit trail defined here (RFC5-25).

Four rules carry most of the weight:

- **Being local proves nothing.** Classification is by credential presented,
  never network location (RFC5-3); a fresh install serves loopback only
  (RFC5-10).
- **Exactly two client classes, exhaustive and closed** (RFC5-3, RFC5-5): a
  browser holding a session, or a machine client holding its own machine
  credential. The web UI, the official `syzygy` CLI, an agent-protocol adapter
  (e.g. MCP), scripts, and fleet workers are all covered by those two, and no
  later contract may add a third.
- **Sessions are the credential and nothing else** (decision B9), so a declared
  maximum lifetime and immediate owner-initiated revocation are the *entire*
  remaining mitigation (RFC5-4).
- **The audit trail lives outside the governed tree** (RFC5-25) — load-bearing,
  because RFC3-16(a)'s owner-act correlation rests on it.

Scope note: this module is **contract shape only**. RFC5-7 enumerates four
machine-credential mechanism classes and selects none; that selection is §8 q1,
scoped there as a V0-implementation choice that cannot change RFC5-6's shape.

---

## 3. The contract

Clauses are numbered `RFC5-n` for stable citation. Amend in place; retire rather
than renumber. A pointer *(history §RFC5-n)* means amendment narrative, prior
wording, or originating decision text was extracted at the rev10 compaction;
that material is non-normative and the clause text is the contract. Decision
identifiers named inline (A1, B4, B9, FD-009, FD-018/FD-029) remain binding
provenance here.

### 3.1 Principals and the single-owner pre-commitment

**RFC5-1.** Every authenticated act binds to exactly one **principal**. The
V0/V1 principal classes are closed: the **owner** (doctrine's single human),
**machine clients** (agent and CLI processes acting on the owner's behalf under
their own credentials, never the owner's), and **Syzygy itself** (attribution of
its writes and adapter effects, SEC-4). Multi-user operation is deferred
[Observed: v1.md deferral table]; three pre-commitments keep later principals
additive rather than structural: (a) authorization is evaluated against a
principal's **scopes**, never against the assumption that exactly one human
exists; (b) every audit record, consent record, and approval Decision names its
principal explicitly, never implying "the owner"; (c) admission
("authenticated") and permission ("authorized") are separate tests everywhere.
What multi-user would add (roles, delegation, per-principal consent authority)
is deliberately absent, not implicitly present.

**RFC5-2.** Sessions and credentials are distinct. A **session** is a bounded,
revocable admission of a browser principal, established through an
owner-attended act (§3.2). A **machine credential** is a durable, scoped,
revocable admission of a machine client (§3.3). Neither is transferable across
client classes: a session cookie never admits a machine client; a machine
credential presented by a browser page does not create a session.

### 3.2 Client classes

**RFC5-3.** Every request is classified as exactly one of two client classes,
**by credential presented, never by network location or header heuristics**: a
request bearing a valid machine credential is a machine client; every other
request is browser-class. Loopback location alone never proves client identity
(SEC-1), and an absent browser `Origin` header is neither automatically trusted
nor treated as a browser-origin violation (SEC-1): absence of a header
classifies nothing — the request must satisfy its class's full discipline.

**The two classes are exhaustive, for all present and future clients** *(rev10
scoping, directive §2 / OD-R10-5).* There is no third client class and **no
later contract may introduce one**: any client that is not a browser holding a
session under RFC5-4 is machine-class, admitted **only** under RFC5-5 and
RFC5-6. This binds the official `syzygy` CLI, agent-protocol adapters (e.g. an
MCP server or equivalent), scripts, and fleet workers alike. Being first-party,
official, packaged with the service, or co-located with it grants a client
nothing. A contract needing a further client class would be **amending this
clause, not extending it**.

**RFC5-4.** Browser-class discipline, **including on loopback**:

- **Session requirement.** State-changing and data-bearing endpoints require an
  established session, minted only through an owner-attended act on a trusted
  channel (first-run pairing on the serving host, or an authenticated login
  under §3.4's non-loopback modes).
- **Session identity is the credential and nothing else** *(ruled at acceptance
  by owner decision B9; history §q2).* A session is **not** bound to a device, a
  device identity, or any network-layer property — the strictest reading of
  SEC-1's "by credential presented, never by network location", declining the
  overlay-network device-identity exception rather than taking it.
- **Lifetime and revocation are therefore binding obligations, not defaults.**
  [Inferred — stated because leaving it implicit would make the ruling less safe
  than the alternative it beat.] With no device binding, an escaped session
  credential is a **complete session anywhere**; how long it stays valid and how
  fast it can be killed are the *only* remaining mitigations. So: every session
  carries a **declared maximum lifetime**, after which it is invalid without
  re-authentication (value is quality-policy material; an **undeclared lifetime
  means sessions do not persist beyond the process**, never an unbounded
  default); and **immediate, owner-initiated revocation of any or all sessions
  is a required capability**, effective at the next request rather than the next
  evaluation — an admission control, not a claim. An implementation offering no
  revocation path does not conform.
- **Anti-CSRF proof.** Every state-changing request carries a per-session
  anti-forgery proof (token or equivalent) a foreign origin cannot read. A
  present `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-Site` header is validated against the mode's
  allowlist; when absent the proof alone decides — per RFC5-3, absence neither
  admits nor condemns.
- **DNS-rebinding defense.** Every browser-class request's `Host` header is
  validated against the closed hostname set of the active exposure mode (§3.4);
  an undeclared host is refused before any application logic runs. A
  browser-originated `localhost` fetch from an arbitrary web page must fail both
  origin validation and the anti-forgery proof — the SEC-1 violation example
  must be structurally impossible, not merely discouraged.

**RFC5-5.** Machine clients are admitted **only** through an explicit
machine-client authentication mechanism (SEC-1). There is no anonymous machine
access on any interface, loopback included; a request with neither session nor
machine credential may reach only the endpoints an unauthenticated visitor may
see, and that set is closed: liveness/health and the authentication bootstrap
itself, neither exposing portfolio data.

**Named machine-class clients** *(rev10 scoping, directive §2 / OD-R10-5).* The
official `syzygy` CLI, agent-protocol adapters (e.g. MCP), scripts, and fleet
workers are machine clients **without exception**. Each presents its own machine
credential under RFC5-6 naming its own machine-client identity — never the
owner's (RFC5-1) — and none is admitted by co-location, packaging, first-party
status, or the fact that one canonical Syzygy service serves all clients over
one semantic API. Any future client of that service is admitted by this clause
or not at all.

### 3.3 Machine-client credentials: the contract shape

**RFC5-6.** A machine credential's contract shape, binding whatever mechanism is
chosen:

- **Identity.** Each credential names one machine-client identity (e.g.
  "beads-adapter on host X", "owner CLI"), minted at issuance, opaque and never
  reused. Identity survives rotation; revocation is per-identity or
  per-credential-instance.
- **Issuance.** Only through an owner-attended ceremony on an already-trusted
  channel (an authenticated session, or the serving host's own console).
  Credentials are never self-issued, never minted by another machine credential,
  and never distributed through an observed project's content.
- **Scoping — deny by default.** A credential carries an explicit scope set:
  which projects it may read, whether it may submit proposals, trigger
  evaluations, or reach adapter-mediated effects. An unscoped credential is
  invalid, not all-powerful. Scope enumeration granularity is RFC 0003/0006
  schema material; the deny-by-default rule is this clause's.
- **Rotation.** Supported without identity change; the old instance is retired
  with an overlap window the owner declares (which may be zero).
- **Revocation.** Effective at the next request (§3.5, acts rule); recorded.
- **Storage.** Syzygy stores only a verifier (hash or public key), never the
  presentable secret; the credential record (identity, scopes, issuance, expiry,
  revocation state) is a governance-plane artifact and contains no secret
  material (SEC-5).

**RFC5-7.** The concrete mechanism is an **enumerated choice for acceptance**
(§8 q1), each satisfying RFC5-6: (a) per-client bearer tokens over TLS (or
loopback), random, hashed at rest; (b) mutual TLS with per-client certificates;
(c) per-client keypairs with signed requests; (d) an OS-mediated local channel
with kernel-verified peer identity (e.g. a Unix domain socket with peer
credentials) — which is *not* "loopback location as identity": the kernel
attests the peer process's identity, a TCP source address attests nothing. More
than one mechanism may be enabled concurrently (e.g. (d) locally, (a) over the
tailnet).

### 3.4 Exposure modes

**RFC5-8.** The exposure-mode set is **closed**: **loopback**;
**owner-controlled overlay network with device identity and TLS** (the "tailnet"
mode — *e.g. Tailscale Serve, named parenthetically only because doctrine's
decision record names it, OQ-007/FD-029; the class term is the normative noun
and no product is chosen here*); and **owner-configured TLS LAN** (FD-009). Each
non-loopback mode requires authenticated, TLS-protected access limited to the
owner's own devices (SEC-1). Enabling any non-loopback mode is an explicit,
recorded owner act naming the mode and its hostname set; an unauthenticated
network-exposed configuration is not a weaker mode — it is an invalid
configuration, and Syzygy **refuses to serve** rather than serve it (fail
closed).

**RFC5-9.** Per-mode obligations:

| Mode | Transport | Device restriction | Syzygy-layer auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| Loopback | Cleartext permitted on the loopback interface only | The serving host | **Full** RFC5-4/5 discipline — loopback never proves identity |
| Overlay network (tailnet) | TLS terminated by the overlay | The owner's overlay devices; network-layer device identity **may satisfy the device-restriction requirement, never the client-classification requirement** — sessions and machine credentials still apply | Full |
| TLS LAN | TLS with owner-provisioned certificates | Owner-declared; no overlay identity exists, so Syzygy-layer auth is the only identity | Full |

**RFC5-10.** A fresh install serves loopback only. Portfolio data is never served
on a non-loopback interface absent the RFC5-8 owner act — the SEC-1 violation
("a fresh install serving portfolio data on a LAN address with no credential")
is a configuration Syzygy must be unable to reach.

### 3.5 Acts versus claims: the temporal rule at the boundary

**RFC5-11.** RFC 0002's temporal machinery (identified evaluations, as-of
instants, degradation-only) governs **truth claims**. Boundary enforcement —
admitting a request, permitting an egress, launching a run — is an **act**,
judged at the instant it is attempted against the then-current credential,
consent, and profile state. Revocation therefore takes effect at the next act,
immediately, without waiting for a new evaluation; the *recomputation* of its
consequences on claims flows through RFC 0002's evaluations. [Inferred — without
this clause, RFC2-4 read literally would delay revocation until someone triggers
an evaluation, which no security rule could tolerate.]

**The rendering obligation.** Recording a revocation **immediately obliges every
subsequent served render of a dependent claim to carry the withdrawal label**
(RFC2-23, "Consent withdrawn"), before and independent of the next evaluation;
the obligation attaches at the revocation record, not at the evaluation that
processes it. The claim is **not** recomputed outside an evaluation — RFC2-4's
evaluation identity and degradation-only rule are untouched and no claim changes
value as a side effect of a security act. What changes is that the surface may
no longer present withdrawn-source content **unlabelled**.

**Revocation forces an evaluation** *(strengthened at acceptance by owner
decision B4; history §q6).* Recording a revocation **triggers a new identified
evaluation** rather than waiting for the next human-triggered one, so the
residual window lasts as long as that evaluation takes, not as long as it takes
someone to run one. **This does not weaken RFC2-4:** the act changes no claim's
value directly, it *schedules* an evaluation, and the value changes inside that
evaluation over a new snapshot carrying the revocation record as an authoritative
input — the improvement route RFC2-4 itself names. **The residual is explicit:**
until that evaluation completes, a dependent claim's *value* is the
pre-revocation one and renders **with the withdrawal visible**, never as current.
[Inferred — the forced trigger is the owner's decision; its reconciliation with
RFC2-4 is this RFC's, and is why the trigger is lawful rather than a carve-out.]

### 3.10 Adapter credentials

**RFC5-24.** Credentials Syzygy itself holds to reach external authorities
through typed adapters (scheduler, version control, CI — VIS-5) are a distinct
credential population from both machine-client credentials (§3.3) and
execution-profile injections (RFC5-20). They are enumerated per adapter and per
authority, scoped to the adapter's authorized effect set, stored under SEC-5
discipline (never in any indexed store or surface), and never visible to
observed-project code.

**The injection prohibition, at its proper width:** **no execution profile may
name as an injectable any credential that authenticates to Syzygy itself.** That
covers adapter credentials **and machine-client credentials (§3.3) explicitly**,
and any future credential population admitted at Syzygy's own boundary.
Rationale, in one line: **SEC-3 classes observed code as untrusted everywhere, so
it may never hold an authenticated route to the authorized surface** — an
injected machine credential would satisfy RFC5-3's classification and RFC5-5's
no-anonymous-access rule *by itself*, turning the isolation floor inside out into
an escalation path. This binds together with RFC5-20's network-policy exclusion
and RFC5-21's floor: no credential to Syzygy, and no route to Syzygy.

Every adapter effect is an authenticated act attributed to Syzygy and audited
(§3.11).

### 3.11 Audit and revocation

**RFC5-25.** **Every authenticated act is attributable.** Each admission, denial,
egress, run launch, adapter effect, consent grant or revocation, credential
issuance, rotation, or revocation emits an **audit record**: principal,
credential or session identity, act, subject, exposure mode, instant, and
outcome. Audit records are **Evidence artifacts** in RFC 0001's sense — durable,
identified, integrity-verifiable, carrying source, capture time, scope, and
provenance — and are therefore citable by claims and consumable by evaluations.
They contain no secret material and no excluded content bodies (RFC5-17): a
rejected request's offending payload is recorded by digest, never by value.

**Where the trail lives — a normative constraint, not a schema choice.** The
audit trail lives **outside `.syzygy/**` and outside the untrusted actor class's
write reach** (SEC-3 as extended at RFC3-16(a)). This is load-bearing, not
organizational: RFC3-16(a)'s class of acceptable owner-act verification mechanisms
includes correlation to a Syzygy-mediated ceremony **recorded in this trail**, and
RFC3-16(b) item 9 requires the binding to be verifiable against it — a trail
placed in the governed tree (including `governance/records/`, which the untrusted
class can write) would let any fleet worker forge the very correlation every
RFC3-16(a) gate rests on, defeating the predicate with no downstream check able to
notice. The trail's storage schema and medium remain implementation-slice choices;
its exclusion from the governed tree and from untrusted write reach does not.
*(Promoted from an open-question annotation to clause text at the rev7 rework
under owner decision A1; history §RFC5-25.)*

**RFC5-26.** Revocation semantics, uniformly: a revocation (credential, session,
consent, profile approval) is a recorded governance act, effective at the next act
per RFC5-11, never retroactive on immutable artifacts, and always renderable —
what was revoked, when, by whom, and what its dependents now render as (Unknown
reasons per RFC 0002). Nothing is ever silently un-revoked: restoration is a fresh
grant with a fresh record.

## 4. Violation cases — this module

*Package numbering is stable; cases are distributed across modules, never
renumbered. Cases 5–6 are in module 2, cases 7–9 and 12 in module 3, case 11
spans two modules and is held in `README.md`.*

1. *(RFC5-3/4)* A loopback endpoint answering an arbitrary web page's fetch; a
   machine client admitted because it connected from 127.0.0.1; a request rejected
   *solely* for an absent `Origin` header.
2. *(RFC5-5/6)* An agent CLI reading portfolio data credential-less "because it's
   local"; a credential minted by another machine credential; a presentable token
   recoverable from any Syzygy store.
3. *(RFC5-8/10)* A fresh install reachable on a LAN address; serving an
   unauthenticated non-loopback configuration instead of refusing.
4. *(RFC5-11)* A revoked credential admitted "until the next evaluation."
10. *(RFC5-24/25)* A profile injecting an adapter credential, **or a machine-client
    credential "so the harness can query the graph"**; a profile declaring
    `loopback-only` and thereby reaching Syzygy's own endpoints; an adapter effect
    with no audit record; an authenticated act whose principal cannot be recovered
    from the audit trail; an audit trail written inside `.syzygy/**` or anywhere
    the untrusted actor class can write.
13. *(RFC5-3/5)* An official CLI, MCP adapter, script, or fleet worker reaching the
    service without a machine credential because it is first-party or co-located;
    a later contract defining a third client class rather than amending RFC5-3.
    *(New at rev10 with the RFC5-3/RFC5-5 scoping.)*

## 5. Integration — this module

**Relies on RFC 0001:** the Decision entity as approval/revocation warrant;
Evidence-artifact semantics for audit records (RFC5-25, SDR-8).
**Relies on RFC 0002:** evaluation identity and the degradation-only rule
(RFC2-4) that RFC5-11 reconciles against; the withdrawal-label rendering
(RFC2-23).
**Relies on RFC 0003:** RFC3-16(a)'s owner-act provenance predicate and
RFC3-16(b) item 9, which RFC5-25's location constraint exists to keep
unforgeable.
**Provides to RFC 0002:** the acts-versus-claims rule (RFC5-11) its temporal
machinery presupposes.
**Provides to RFC 0003:** the fields credential records and audit records must
encode, **including RFC5-25's out-of-tree location constraint**, which is
normative and not a schema choice; RFC 0003 owns physical schema and migration.
**Provides to RFC 0004:** the adapter-credential discipline (RFC5-24).
**Provides to RFC 0006 and the surfaces (incl. RFC 0008):** session semantics for
URL/selection state.
**Provides to RFC 0010 and RFC 0011:** the closed two-class client contract
(RFC5-3, RFC5-5, RFC5-6) under which the official `syzygy` CLI, agent-protocol
adapters, scripts, and fleet workers reach the canonical service.
**Not this module's:** scope-enumeration granularity and wire formats (RFC 0003 /
RFC 0006); multi-user roles (deferred).

---

## 7. Deliberately deferred — this module

Concrete schemas for credential and audit records → RFC 0003. Session/URL
semantics detail → RFC 0006. Audit-retention periods → quality/evidence policy
(craft). Multi-user principals, roles, delegation → post-V1, behind the RFC5-1
pre-commitments. Certificate interactions → post-V1 certificate RFC.

## 8. Owner questions owned by this module

Question numbers are **RFC-level and immutable** — q1…q6 keep their numbers
wherever they physically live. See `README.md` for the package question list.

**q1. Machine-client mechanism (SDR §5 q8) — OPEN.** Accept one of RFC5-7's classes
as V0's mechanism — (a) hashed bearer tokens, (b) mutual TLS, (c) signed requests,
(d) OS-mediated peer identity — or accept (d) for local plus (a) for tailnet as the
proposed pairing?

> **Scope ruling (rev10, directive §2 / OD-R10-5) — this ruling does not answer the
> question, and the author does not select a mechanism.** The question selects among
> RFC5-7's four enumerated mechanism classes, **each of which satisfies RFC5-6's
> contract shape identically**. It therefore **cannot alter the meaning of any
> specification authored against RFC5-6**: Mission Control (RFC 0010), the official
> `syzygy` CLI, and an agent-protocol (e.g. MCP) adapter cite the contract shape —
> one named identity per credential, owner-attended issuance on an already-trusted
> channel, deny-by-default scoping, rotation without identity change, revocation
> effective at the next act, verifier-only storage — never the mechanism that
> carries it. What remains open is **credential technology, not the boundary**.
> Classification: **must close before V0 implementation; it does not block
> specification.** The browser-versus-machine-client contract is **closed**: RFC5-3
> (two classes, exhaustive for all present and future clients, no third class
> introducible by a later contract), RFC5-5 (no anonymous machine access; the
> official CLI, agent-protocol adapters, scripts and fleet workers are machine
> clients without exception), and RFC5-6 (the contract shape every mechanism must
> satisfy).

**q2. Overlay-network device identity for browser sessions — ANSWERED (owner
decision B9).** The exception is **declined**: session identity is the credential
and nothing else, with no device or network-layer binding. The consequence is
binding in RFC5-4 (declared maximum lifetime; undeclared = no persistence beyond
the process; immediate owner-initiated revocation) and is the **entire** remaining
mitigation. Question as posed and answer verbatim:
`../../history/RFC-0005-history.md` §q2.

**q5. Rotation overlap default — OPEN.** RFC5-6 lets the owner declare an overlap
window per rotation. Should the default be zero (strict) or a bounded nonzero grace
(operationally kinder)? Proposed: zero.

**q6. Revocation rendering versus re-evaluation (RFC5-11) — ANSWERED (owner
decision B4).** The **stronger form** is taken: revocation forces a new identified
evaluation rather than waiting for the next human-triggered one; RFC2-4 is
unweakened because the security act *schedules* an evaluation rather than mutating
a claim. Binding in RFC5-11. Question as posed and answer verbatim:
`../../history/RFC-0005-history.md` §q6.
