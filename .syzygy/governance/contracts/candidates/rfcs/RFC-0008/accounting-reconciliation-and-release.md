# RFC 0008 — Trajectory (Work Surface): accounting, reconciliation, release

**Status:** Proposed foundational contract (self-declaration at authoring
time). Effective status is established solely by an owner-act record binding
this file's exact content digest — as an owner-adopted bootstrap act until the
independent A1 correlation mechanism exists, and as a Syzygy-verified effective
act only after correlation (RFC3-16). Absent such a record, this contract binds
nothing.

**Package:** module 3 of 3 of the RFC 0008 contract package. Index, clause map,
lookup rule, package-level integration and deferrals: `README.md`. Rationale,
amendment history, rejected alternatives, and answered §8 questions:
`../../history/RFC-0008-history.md`.

**Serves:** vision.md Thesis (work is never proof), VIS-1, VIS-2, VIS-6,
VIS-7; SEC-5; trust-and-evidence.md (traceable authority; a narrative sentence
doing a badge's work is judged as a badge). Implements **owner rulings**
SDR-9, SDR-10, SDR-11, SDR-12.

## 0. Module scope and reader map (non-normative)

*If this section and a clause ever disagree, the clause wins.*

This module owns **the account of what actually changed and whether it
satisfied anything**: the bidirectional change-accounting chain and its honest
thinness (RFC8-21), broken joins that render rather than vanish (RFC8-22),
Unknown-provenance work and the RFC2-24 reasons this surface renders
(RFC8-23/8-24), inherited-mutation accounting under a fail-closed threshold and
a warrant-coverage test (RFC8-25), the binding compaction preservation set and
expired-detail tier rules (RFC8-26/8-27), the four-way post-merge chain-state
distinction, its closed six-value vocabulary and the forbidden closure fallacy
(RFC8-28/8-29/8-30), RFC 0006 conformance, endpoint answerability and this
surface's non-visual parity floor (RFC8-31), and the binding phase rule at
the OpenSpec seam (RFC8-32). Read it to answer: *what did the fleet change,
under whose authority, at what cost — and has any of it been checked against
the intent that warranted it?*

Four rules carry most of the weight. **A broken join renders**; reconstructing
one by similarity, interpolation, or inference is forbidden (RFC8-22).
**A warrant is never extended by execution-side prose** — anything outside the
parent warrant's declared scope renders Unknown-provenance, and where no "small"
threshold is declared **no mutation inherits at all** (RFC8-25; owner decision
B13). **No observer or surface ever upgrades a tier** (RFC8-27). And the four
post-merge answers — *reconciled at E with evidence*, *merged, not yet
evaluated*, *evaluated and unsatisfied*, *evaluated, contradiction raised* —
**must never share a rendering**, and never differ by colour alone (RFC8-28).

**Phase boundary.** RFC8-32 is binding and applies to the whole package: no
implementation work for user-observable Trajectory behavior may be scheduled
solely from these RFCs.

The normalized work state that travels beside this module's chain state is
defined in module 2 (RFC8-12/8-13); the materialization join the chain runs
through is in module 1 (RFC8-10).

## 3. The contract

Clauses are numbered `RFC8-n` for stable citation. Amend in place; retire
rather than renumber.

### 3.10 The change-accounting chain

**RFC8-21.** Trajectory must walk, in both directions, the chain: **warrant
(normative reference or Decision) → approved plan item (execution-intent
Proposal) → materialization record → work item → execution run(s) →
commits/PR → merge fact → reconciliation verdict** — joined on the RFC1-25
relations (`motivates`, `materializes`, `produced_by`, `supports`) and the
RFC4-22 adapter joins, each rendered with its declared basis
(`recorded-identity` vs `naming-convention`, the latter `reduced-fidelity`).
**Against today's actuator toolchain this chain is honest but thin**: several
links resolve only by naming convention, and the enrichments that would carry
them to event-time Observed are on the RFC4-29 roadmap and deliberately **not
required**. **That thinness must render as thinness**, and must never be
presented — in this RFC, in the surface, or in an acceptance test — as a chain
awaiting completion rather than one that is complete and weak. [Inferred]

**RFC8-22.** **A broken join renders; it is never silently skipped.** Where a
link cannot be established at the answering evaluation, the chain renders the
break at that link — Unknown with its RFC2-24 reason — and everything
downstream renders with provenance degraded accordingly. Reconstructing a join
by similarity, interpolation, or inference is forbidden (RFC4-22; missing
evidence never renders Inferred [Observed: trust-and-evidence.md]).

### 3.11 Unknown-provenance work and the reasons this surface renders

**RFC8-23.** A work item, run, or merged change with **no traceable warrant**
renders **Unknown-provenance**: a first-class, filterable, counted rendered
state — never green, never silently pooled into warranted work, and never an
ingest rejection (RFC4-10). A substrate-side warrant-field edit is an
annotation, not a competing warrant (RFC8-11); the human intent behind such an
edit surfaces as a Proposal against the plan item, where a warrant change
belongs.

**Unknown-provenance is not orphaned work, and this clause never absorbs it.**
An Unknown-provenance item may be legitimate untraceable work — a pre-Syzygy
backlog item, an import — and its route is *surface it*: counted, never green,
resolvable by supplying a warrant. An **orphaned work item** is two stores
answering one question (RFC8-8; RFC1-29), and its **only** lawful exit is
owner adjudication (RFC1-21; RFC2-15). Rendering one as Unknown-provenance
mis-routes it, skips minting the Contradiction, and skips RFC2-15's Unknown
rendering of the affected conclusion. Where an item is both, the orphaned-work
Contradiction governs and is never filtered away behind the provenance badge.

**RFC8-24.** The RFC2-24 reasons Trajectory most renders **on its claims**,
each with its route visible: `missing-evidence` (no gate artifact behind a
claimed outcome — SDR-9); `source-uncaptured-or-unreachable` (adapter export
unavailable; facts lost past the retention horizon before capture, rendered
**citing the retention event**, never "no work existed" — RFC4-16);
`no-currency-bound-declared` (undeclared staleness bound, undeclared retention
bound, **or an undeclared maximum inter-pass interval** — RFC4-16(2): the
interval is the only thing that *bounds* pre-horizon history loss rather than
merely rendering it honestly, so until it is declared, every claim depending
on pre-horizon scheduler history renders Unknown on these mechanics, and the
fleet-day account renders that dependence visibly);
`stale-beyond-currency-bound`; `missing-declaration` (a governing declaration
— capability, topology, mapping, policy — absent behind a claim). Unknown
aggregation follows RFC2-24's rendering rule: aggregate, disclose reason
counts, expand. **These are claim reasons only:** the normalized state's four
absence values are state-local, take no reason from this list, and are counted
separately — an aggregate of Unknowns never absorbs them (RFC8-12; RFC6-6).

### 3.12 Inherited mutations (SDR-11)

**RFC8-25.** Small inherited mutations — warranted changes riding a parent
work item without one of their own — appear as **sub-entries of the parent
run's summary** (within the parent's Execution Record), each with rationale
and touched surfaces; never one work item each, never invisible. A diff hunk
resolving to no work item and no parent run summary renders
**Unknown-provenance** (RFC8-23) — the honest form of unexplained diff
coverage, never omitted from the account.

**"Small" is a declared per-project threshold, and its absence fails closed**
*(ruled at acceptance by owner decision B13, answering §8 q6).* The threshold
is **quality-policy material** (`governance/policies/`, RFC3-15): the
obligation to declare it binds now, the value is the owner's and may differ
per project, and the declared value is a snapshot input (RFC2-1 item 7).
**Where no threshold is declared, no mutation inherits** — every change
requires its own warrant, and the account renders the absent policy rather
than assuming a permissive bound. Size, count, and scope-breadth bounds are
the owner's call, never the implementation's and never the worker's.
[Inferred — left undeclared and permissive, "small" is decided by the worker
writing the summary, whose prose RFC4-19 already classes as worker-asserted;
argument in history.]

**Warrant coverage is a test, not a presumption.** The fleet-day account
attributes an inherited mutation's diff through the parent's warrant **only
where the mutation's touched surfaces fall within that warrant's declared
scope** — the requirement, scenario, governance clause, or Decision the parent
work item's `motivates` edge names (RFC1-25, whose warrant classes are closed;
trust-and-evidence.md: a work warrant requires *traceable authority*).
**Anything outside that scope does not inherit**: it renders
**Unknown-provenance per RFC8-23**, counted and never green, exactly as if no
parent summary existed. **A warrant is never extended by execution-side
prose**; a worker cannot widen the authority under which it acted by
describing what it also did.

**The sub-entry's tier is fixed.** Its rationale and touched-surface list live
in a worker-authored Execution Record whose prose fields RFC4-19 classes as
optional enrichment, so the sub-entry renders **`asserted-by-worker`** (parent
label Inferred, RFC2-25) — visible, challengeable, and **never a status
input** — unless the touched surfaces are independently evidenced from VCS or
gate artifacts, which render at their own tiers. RFC8-27 keeps that tier
through compaction; this fixes it before.

### 3.13 Compaction and retention rendering (SDR-10)

**RFC8-26.** **The preservation set is binding**: structured run summaries,
work warrants, decisions, materialization mappings, known cost/token totals,
evidence identities and hashes, and reconciliation outcomes survive every
compaction. Raw transcripts and verbose logs may expire under declared policy.
A compaction is itself an identified, durable record (RFC8-6).

**RFC8-27.** **Expired-detail rendering.** A claim whose only substantiation
lived in expired material renders Unknown **citing the compaction or retention
event** — never absent, never confidently restated from the summary.
Preserved summaries render at their recorded tier: a summarized worker
assertion stays `asserted-by-worker`; a preserved gate outcome **renders at
the tier its evaluation recorded** — an observation record is immutable
(RFC2-6), and no later event at the provider changes what an existing
evaluation concluded. For RFC4-13 route 2 the snapshot holds the
**external-confirmation capture artifact** (RFC4-13(a)) and the tier stands on
that, so a CI provider expiring its check records after ninety days expires
nothing in Syzygy. A **later re-confirmation is a new observation** in a new
snapshot, whose evaluation may honestly find the provider no longer confirms
and record a degraded tier **there** (RFC2-4's new-snapshot path) —
degradation happens only through a new identified evaluation, never by a
stored record's meaning shifting under a display query. Artifact
resolvability alone is still not the test (RFC4-13, amended under AS-R3;
RFC 0004's alternatives record — `../../history/RFC-0004-history.md` §6 —
lists "`gate-backed` on retention and format alone" as Rejected): a preserved
hash with no capture artifact and no other satisfied route **caps at
`report-fact`**, with the cap visible. An artifact simply
**gone** drops tier in the next evaluation with the dangling reference
rendered broken. **No observer or surface ever *upgrades* a tier** (RFC4-13);
only new evidence in a new snapshot can. "No records found" must be visually
and queryably distinguishable from "nothing happened" [Observed: substrate
audit, adopted as binding].

### 3.14 Post-merge reconciliation rendering

**RFC8-28.** The RFC2-18 chain states — `merged`, `reconciliation-pending`,
`reconciled@E`, `unsatisfied`, `contradiction-raised`, `Unknown(reason)` — are
**first-class Trajectory states**, queryable and filterable on the durable
identity: *reconciled at E with evidence* vs *merged, not yet evaluated* vs
*evaluated and unsatisfied* vs *evaluated, contradiction raised* are four
different answers and **must never share a rendering**. Unqualified
"reconciliation" means only the doctrinal sense; scheduler-state repair never
shares a field, count, or UI string with it — and the same reservation binds
`unsatisfied` (a gap) against `contradiction-raised` (a Contradiction, owner
adjudication only), which Trajectory must never merge into one count or one
badge (RFC2-17; RFC4-6).

**Six values, closed.** The chain-state vocabulary above is closed at those
six values, and **no implementation may mint, spell, or force-fit one outside
it** — the closure RFC8-12 cites this clause for, stated here in RFC8-12's own
form and for its reason: a value the contract never names can be neither
carried verbatim on a machine answer (RFC6-14) nor checked for parity, and
RFC6-22/23 make the resulting disagreement release-blocking under the trust
floor. Closing the field is what makes it the least-protected load-bearing
facet no longer: it carries the reconciliation truth, and it is the one
vocabulary an implementation would otherwise be free to spell for itself.

**Never a colour-only distinction.** The four post-merge answers, and
`unsatisfied` against `contradiction-raised` in particular, **never share a
mark, a mark's colour, a count, or a legend entry** — the map surface binds
the identical sentence (RFC9-32), and a distinction only colour carries is not
a distinction under RFC6-22/23's parity test. Two differently-coloured badges
do not discharge this clause: the reader on the surface that routes a gap to
work and a Contradiction to owner adjudication alone must be able to tell them
apart **without colour**, by label, text, or structure.

**The chain state is a field of its own, separate from RFC8-12's normalized
work state**, and the two travel together — never one in place of the other. A
rendering showing normalized `merged` without the item's chain state collapses
the three post-merge answers into a single mark, which this clause forbids.
**Every rendering, filter, count, endpoint answer, and cross-surface handoff
that carries the normalized state carries the chain state beside it**,
including RFC9-32's work/construction overlay (§5).

**RFC8-29.** **V0 renders the absence honestly** (SDR-12; RFC2-19): every
merged-but-unreconciled item renders "reconciliation evidence absent /
Unknown," and a wall of such Unknowns on a fleet-built project is correct
output, not a defect. Nothing in V0 simulates a verdict. **V1 computes** the
reconciliation evaluation and renders its gap as a navigable object.

**RFC8-30.** **The closure fallacy is forbidden.** No Trajectory aggregate,
badge, progress bar, or prose sentence renders a `closed` work item as done,
complete, or satisfied absent a `reconciled@E` verdict with gate-backed
evidence — a narrative sentence doing a badge's work is judged as a badge
[Observed: trust-and-evidence.md]. Progress aggregates over merged work
disclose their reconciliation composition (n reconciled, m pending, k
unsatisfied, c contradiction-raised, j Unknown).

### 3.15 Selection, drawer, endpoints

**RFC8-31.** Every Trajectory rendering obeys RFC 0006: selection by kernel
identity only (no work-item row handles across boundaries, RFC6-1), the single
drawer fact set (RFC6-18/19), label parity on every machine answer (RFC6-14),
evaluation stamping (RFC6-15), aggregation disclosure (RFC6-17), the **closed
navigation-outcome set including `incompatible-scenario`** (RFC6-5), and
**explicit, singular scenario context on every selection** (RFC6-24) that
**travels with every URL, cross-surface synchronization, and query answer**
(RFC6-25) — a queue row, a remaining-work count, and an endpoint answer each
carry the context they were computed under, and a surface may never silently
swap it. Trajectory adds **no surface-only facts**: anything it renders —
normalized states, blocked causes, chain joins, cost measures — is queryable
with identical labels, and its answers ("what remains," "what changed," "what
still lacks reconciliation") are endpoint-answerable at a named evaluation.

**Non-visual parity binds this surface too, and is stated here rather than
left to the sibling surfaces.** Polaris binds it at RFC7-33/34; no doctrine
clause distinguishes surfaces, and this surface's distinctions are the ones
routing a reader to work or to owner adjudication. Two limbs, both binding:

- **Recoverable without colour, position, or layout.** Every normalized work
  state (RFC8-12), every chain state (RFC8-28), every blocked-cause set
  (RFC8-17), the Unknown-provenance state (RFC8-23), and every state-local
  absence value is carried **textually** — by label or structure — on every
  rendering and every export, never by a colour, a column position, or a
  board lane alone. This is RFC6-14's verbatim-carriage rule made a rendering
  obligation: what an endpoint must carry, a human-readable rendering carries
  too.
- **Operable without a pointing device.** The board/queue/drawer handoff
  (RFC6-18) and every traversal between a work item, its chain state, its
  Execution Records and its evidence is operable by keyboard. Recoverability
  governs *encoding*; operability is a separate obligation and both bind — a
  surface whose every unit is recoverable and whose paths between units are
  pointer-only has satisfied neither (RFC7-34's reasoning, applied here).

*(Stated as a limb of RFC8-31 rather than as a new clause: the `RFC8-n` range
is closed at RFC8-32 and this package mints no lettered sub-clauses
(`README.md`). The limb binds exactly as a clause would, and RFC8-32's
coverage matrix reaches it through RFC8-31.)*

### 3.16 Authority boundary at the OpenSpec seam (binding phase rule)

**RFC8-32 — This contract schedules nothing.** This RFC fixes the semantics of
the work surface; it is **not a specification of record from which
implementation work may be scheduled**. No implementation work for
**user-observable Trajectory behavior** may be scheduled solely from this RFC:
before implementation, every observable consequence of **every clause of this
contract other than this one** must either **map to an approved OpenSpec
requirement or scenario** in the governance root's `openspec/**` plane, or
carry an **explicit, reviewed N/A judgment** recording why that consequence
needs no requirement. **The
reviewed N/A judgment's home and gate.** A reviewed N/A judgment is a recorded
owner judgment homed in `decisions/` (RFC3-15), and it is honored only where
its owner-act provenance is verifiable under RFC3-16(a). Where that provenance
does not verify, the judgment maps nothing: the consequence remains unmapped
and renders Unknown, never covered (RFC3-16(a)'s effect rule; VIS-2). The
surface-specification phase must produce, as a
deliverable, a **clause-to-requirement coverage matrix** for this RFC — every
clause mapped to requirement identities or to its reviewed N/A — and that
matrix is review material, never authority. This clause creates no OpenSpec
content now (none may exist during bootstrap); it binds the phase boundary so
RFC prose is never quietly treated as an implementable behavioral spec.

**The scope is stated without a range on purpose.** A numeric range copied
into a clause goes stale the moment a clause is appended, and the appended
clause is then the one no coverage matrix reaches. "Every clause of this
contract other than this one" needs no maintenance and covers every future
append.

**Rows are per observable consequence, not per clause.** A clause with five
observable consequences and one mapped requirement is not covered; the matrix
discloses the consequences it enumerates for each clause, so a
complete-looking matrix over under-enumerated consequences is a defect of the
matrix.

**Why the judgment is gated at all.** It *removes* an implementation
obligation, which makes it authorization-bearing on RFC3-16(a)'s own test —
the same predicate and the same failure posture RFC8-12's derivation mapping
and RFC8-16's staleness bound already invoke in this package.
`.syzygy/governance/**` is writable by the untrusted fleet-worker class
(SEC-3, as RFC3-16(a) extends it to committed artifacts), and an N/A judgment
that class could commit is the one artifact that turns "this clause needs a
requirement" into "this clause needs nothing".

## 4. Violation cases

*Package numbering; cases are distributed to the module owning their clauses
and are never renumbered. Cases 4 and 12 span modules and are held in
`README.md` §4.*

8. *(RFC8-21/22)* A chain rendered complete by fuzzy-matching a deleted branch
   name; a broken warrant join skipped so the chain "reads clean."
9. *(RFC8-25/27)* Cleanup hunks invisible in the fleet-day account; a gate
   rendered `gate-backed` after its artifact expired; "no work existed" where
   the honest output is Unknown citing the retention event.
10. *(RFC8-28/30)* "Reconciled: 12" counted from scheduler-repair events; a
    100% progress bar over merged-but-unreconciled work.
14. *(RFC8-25)* A one-line parent work item carrying forty sub-entries across
    three capabilities, attributed through a warrant that never covered them —
    an *accounted* oversized diff.

---

## 5. Integration — this module

**Relies on RFC 0001:** the RFC1-25 relations the chain joins on (`motivates`,
`materializes`, `produced_by`, `supports`), whose warrant classes are closed;
adjudication-only Contradiction exits (RFC1-21); the derived-absence rule that
keeps a gap from becoming a work warrant (RFC1-21). **RFC 0002:** the
reconciliation chain, its reserved word, and the deliberately-triggered pass
(RFC2-17…2-20); the immutable observation record (RFC2-6) and lawful tier
degradation only through a new identified evaluation (RFC2-4); the Unknown
reason registry and its aggregation rule (RFC2-24); the tier registry
(RFC2-25); the Unknown rendering of a conclusion suspended pending adjudication
(RFC2-15); snapshot inputs for declared policy values (RFC2-1 item 7).
**RFC 0003:** quality-policy material for the inherited-mutation threshold and
the `decisions/` home of RFC8-32's reviewed N/A judgment (RFC3-15); the
owner-act provenance predicate that judgment is honored under (RFC3-16(a)).
**RFC 0007:** the intent surface's machine-parity and non-visual obligations
(RFC7-33/34), whose floor RFC8-31 states for this surface rather than
inheriting. **RFC 0004:** Unknown-provenance is never an ingest rejection
(RFC4-10); the `gate-backed` provenance predicate and its capture-time
confirmation (RFC4-13, incl. RFC4-13(a)); capture-before-horizon **and its
declared maximum inter-pass interval** (RFC4-16, incl. RFC4-16(2)); the run
envelope whose prose fields are class-O optional enrichment (RFC4-19); join
bases and their declared fidelity (RFC4-22); the co-evolution roadmap that is
deliberately never required (RFC4-29). **RFC 0005:** machine-client admission
(**RFC5-5** — machine clients are admitted only through an explicit, revocable
admission, and agent and CLI clients are machine clients without exception)
behind RFC8-31's endpoint answers. **RFC 0006:** selection by kernel identity
(RFC6-1); the closed navigation-outcome set (RFC6-5); outcomes are not Unknown
reasons (RFC6-6); label parity (RFC6-14); evaluation stamping (RFC6-15);
aggregation disclosure (RFC6-17); the single drawer fact set (RFC6-18/19);
scenario context and its travel (RFC6-24/25).

**Provides to RFC 0009:** the **RFC2-18 chain state** half of the two-field
handoff RFC9-32 consumes (RFC8-28), with RFC2-17's word reservation binding the
overlay — `unsatisfied` and `contradiction-raised` never merge into one count,
badge, or mark, and neither collapses into `merged`. The other half is the
normalized work state (RFC8-12/8-13, module 2); the conformance rule binding
both halves is stated once, at RFC8-12 (README §5 restates it). Also to RFC 0009: the
touched-components measure's dependence on the declared implementation mapping
(RFC8-18, module 2). **To RFC 0010:** the reconciliation chain state a Mission
must render before claiming an objective achieved, and RFC8-30's prohibition on
any aggregate rendering closed work as done absent `reconciled@E`. **To
RFC 0011:** the compaction preservation set and expired-detail semantics a
context packet's durable memory binds against (RFC8-26/8-27).

---

## 7. Deliberately deferred — this module

The V1 reconciliation-gap computation → V1 RFC (SDR-12 staging). The
inherited-mutation "small" threshold **value** → quality policy per owner
decision B13; only the value defers, and until it is declared no mutation
inherits (RFC8-25). The maximum inter-pass interval RFC4-16(2) requires the
quality policy to declare → quality/evidence policy; the obligation binds now,
and Trajectory is where an undeclared interval renders (RFC8-24). Retention
policy for raw transcripts and verbose logs → declared policy (RFC8-26).

---

## 8. Owner questions

*Package numbering; question numbers never shift. Answered items keep their
number here and their full text and reasoning live in
`../../history/RFC-0008-history.md` §8. Full package index: `README.md` §8.*

4. **Unknown-provenance visibility default (RFC8-23) — OPEN.** Filterable but
   always counted. Should the fleet-day account view pin it (always visible,
   never filtered out), as the surface's main honesty signal about untraceable
   work? Proposed: yes for the account view; ordinary boards may filter with
   the count disclosed. **Scope limit:** this governs Unknown-provenance only.
   The **orphaned-work Contradiction** (RFC8-8/8-10, module 1) is *not*
   filterable under any answer — its only lawful exit is adjudication
   (RFC1-21; RFC2-15).
6. **The "small" threshold on inherited mutations (RFC8-25; SDR-11).**
   **ANSWERED — owner decision B13:** the threshold is declared per project as
   quality-policy material and **fails closed** — where none is declared, no
   mutation inherits. See `../../history/RFC-0008-history.md` §8 q6, which also
   records the rev9 fallback sentence this ruling superseded.

---

*End of RFC 0008 module 3. Clauses RFC8-21 … RFC8-32, contiguous — no gaps,
nothing merged, nothing retired. RFC8-32 binds the phase boundary for the whole
package.*
