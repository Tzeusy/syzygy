# RFC 0008 — Trajectory (Work Surface)

**Status:** Proposed foundational contract (self-declaration at authoring
time). Effective status is established solely by an owner-act record binding
each module file's exact content digest — as an owner-adopted bootstrap act
until the independent A1 correlation mechanism exists, and as a Syzygy-verified
effective act only after correlation (RFC3-16). Absent such a record, this
contract binds nothing.

**Date:** 2026-07-30 (amended through 2026-08-02; compacted and split into a
package at rev10). **Rationale, amendment history, rejected alternatives, the
resolved foundation-defect trail, and answered §8 questions:**
`../../history/RFC-0008-history.md` (non-normative).

**Serves:** vision.md Thesis (three states; work is never proof), VIS-1, VIS-2,
VIS-5, VIS-6, VIS-7; architecture.md (typed authority; `work/`); SEC-2, SEC-3,
SEC-5; trust-and-evidence.md. Implements **owner rulings** SDR-5, SDR-6, SDR-7,
SDR-8, SDR-9, SDR-10, SDR-11, SDR-12, SDR-18 and the SDR §2 Trajectory charter;
resolves the work-ontology portion of SDR §5 question 10.

## Clause map and lookup rule

**Every clause identity appears in exactly one module.** One `RFC8-n`
namespace, no duplicated normative clauses, no renumbering.

| Module | File | Clauses |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — identity, authority, materialization | `identity-authority-materialization.md` | RFC8-1..RFC8-11 |
| 2 — state vocabulary, liveness, cost | `state-vocabulary-and-cost.md` | RFC8-12..RFC8-20 |
| 3 — accounting, reconciliation, release | `accounting-reconciliation-and-release.md` | RFC8-21..RFC8-32 |

Module sizes are deliberately **not stated here**. A measurement copied into
contract prose goes stale the moment any module moves, and moves this
package's content digest for a reason that has nothing to do with what the
package says. This artifact is governed by the applicable context-budget
policy; the current measurement lives in the generated budget report
`../../CONTEXT-BUDGET-REPORT.md`, which is regenerated, never transcribed.

**Lookup rule (deterministic).** For any citation `RFC8-n`, read `n` as an
integer and take the first row whose range contains it. The three ranges are
contiguous and exhaustive over RFC8-1…RFC8-32 with no gaps, so the rule never
needs a search. Modules are numbered for reading order only — citations name
clauses, never modules.

**No lettered sub-clauses.** Lettered limbs cited inside a clause — RFC8-2(a)–(c),
RFC8-8(a)–(c) — are *parts of that clause*, list items within one clause body,
not separate sub-clauses with their own headings. They resolve to their parent
clause's module.

**Reading order for a cold reader:** module 1 → 2 → 3. Module 1 establishes
what work exists and under whose authority; module 2 gives the vocabulary every
rendering speaks; module 3 accounts for what changed and whether it satisfied
anything. Modules 2 and 3 are independently readable given module 1.

**Reader groups.** Adapter and endpoint authors read module 2. Board, queue,
and aggregate implementers read module 3. Mission Control and dispatch read
module 1 for the materialization join, then module 2 for the state vocabulary.

## Package reader map (non-normative)

*If this map and a clause disagree, the clause wins.*

Trajectory (`work/`) is the owner's complete, evidence-linked account of the
project's work: what remains, what is approved but unmaterialized, planned,
ready, active, blocked, under review, merged, what it cost, why each piece was
authorized — and the distinction no tracker carries, **what merged without yet
being reconciled against the intent that warranted it** [Observed: SDR §2
charter]. This package is the surface's **semantic contract, not its UI
design**.

Four rules carry most of the weight, distributed across the modules:

- **the anti-thesis is binding** — Trajectory is never a second editable store
  of a scheduler-owned field, never a view in which closure renders as done,
  and never a board that cannot answer "what did the fleet change, at what
  cost, under whose authority" for a past window (module 1, RFC8-2);
- **a scheduler work item with no materialization record is a Contradiction,
  not a badge**, whose only lawful exit is owner adjudication (module 1,
  RFC8-8/8-10);
- work renders through a **closed thirteen-value normalized state vocabulary**
  in three partitions, every value with a declared derivation and an honest
  absence behavior; nothing is guessed or force-fitted (module 2,
  RFC8-12/8-13);
- the four post-merge answers — *reconciled at E with evidence*, *merged, not
  yet evaluated*, *evaluated and unsatisfied*, *evaluated, contradiction
  raised* — **must never share a rendering**, and at V0 the honest answer for
  merged work is "reconciliation evidence absent" (module 3, RFC8-28/8-29).

Two invariants span the package. **Cost is independent measures, never a
composite "effort" score**; absent values are Unknown, never zero; every
aggregate discloses coverage (RFC8-18/8-19). And **every diff is accounted
for**: work with no traceable warrant renders Unknown-provenance, counted and
never green (RFC8-23), and a change riding a parent work item inherits that
warrant only inside its declared scope and a declared per-project threshold
whose absence fails closed (RFC8-25).

## 2. Doctrine grounding (non-normative)

Doctrine keeps desired, observed-implementation, and execution state
semantically distinct, and rules that scheduled or completed work is never
proof intent is satisfied [Observed: vision.md, Thesis]. The lived failure this
surface ends is the amnesiac orchestration day — "oversized diffs and scattered
completions with no coherent account" [Observed: vision.md]. The account's
lower half is largely non-existent on today's substrate: no run identity, no
durable gate artifacts, no reconciliation object anywhere, warrants as prose, a
scheduler that forgets by default [Observed: substrate audit —
non-authoritative, adopted where cited; citations in history]. The owner staged
the answers: post-hoc telemetry at V1 (SDR-5), Unknown-never-zero (SDR-6),
pre-materialization authority (SDR-7), reconciliation absence rendered at V0
and computed at V1 (SDR-12).

[Inferred] Three failure modes are guarded against, each individually
attractive to an implementer and each manufacturing exactly the comprehensible
fiction VIS-1 forbids: the **mirror** (a second editable copy of scheduler
state), the **closure fallacy** (execution closure rendered as done), and the
**amnesiac board** (current columns, no account of change, cost, or authority).

## 4. Violation cases — package-spanning

*Cases 1–3 and 11 are in module 1, 5–7 and 13 in module 2, 8–10 and 14 in
module 3. Numbering is the stable package numbering; cases are distributed,
never renumbered. Only cases 4 and 12 span two modules and are held here.*

4. *(RFC8-11/23)* A substrate `spec_id` edit adjudicated as a warrant
   contradiction — or, worse, adopted as the new warrant.
12. *(RFC8-8/9/13)* Two approved proposals in one exclusivity group listed as
    two queue rows and counted "what remains: 2" — fictitious consensus
    arriving through a count; a queue row or endpoint answer served without its
    scenario context.

## 5. Integration — package-level

Per-module relies-on lists are in each module's §5. Two items are stated once,
here, because they bind across modules.

**The RFC 0009 handoff is two orthogonal fields, not one** (RFC8-12; RFC8-28),
and RFC9-32's work/construction overlay consumes **both**:

1. the **normalized work state** — RFC8-12/8-13's closed vocabulary (module 2),
   at present **thirteen values in three partitions**, not eight: eight live
   states, the terminal `closed-unmerged`, and four state-local absence values.
   Each partition renders as itself; the absence values are never folded into
   an Unknown-reason aggregate.
2. the **RFC2-18 chain state** — `merged`, `reconciliation-pending`,
   `reconciled@E`, `unsatisfied`, `contradiction-raised`, `Unknown(reason)`
   (module 3) — carried beside the normalized state on every element and every
   aggregate, with **RFC2-17's word reservation binding the overlay**:
   `unsatisfied` and `contradiction-raised` never merge into one count, badge,
   or mark, and neither collapses into `merged`.

Stated as **two fields** rather than a value count on purpose, since a
count-shaped handoff fails silently whenever either vocabulary grows: **a
consumer conforms by consuming both fields and rendering every value each field
currently carries**, so an addition to either vocabulary crosses the seam
without amending this paragraph, and a value the consumer cannot render is a
defect in the consumer, never a licence to fold it into a neighbour.

**One foundation defect is outstanding** — RFC1-28/31 omit the
queued-for-materialization stage; it is held in module 1 §5 with §8 q2. Four
further defects reported against RFC 0001/0002 are **closed** and the trail is
preserved in `../../history/RFC-0008-history.md` §5. **No RFC 0001 or RFC 0002
change is outstanding on any of the four, and none blocks acceptance.**

**Provides to:** **RFC 0007** — the SDR-18 boundary (RFC8-9): drafting queue
and work lifecycle here, contextual intent authoring and adoption there.
**RFC 0009** — the two-field work-state handoff above, and the
touched-components measure's dependence on the declared implementation mapping
(RFC8-18). **RFC 0010** — the work-state vocabulary a Mission lifecycle must
interoperate with, the materialization join and orphaned-work Contradiction a
Mission must respect before treating work as authorized, the cost measures a
Mission budget is accounted in, and RFC8-30's prohibition on rendering closed
work as done absent `reconciled@E`. **RFC 0011** — the compaction preservation
set and expired-detail semantics a context packet's durable memory binds
against (RFC8-26/8-27).

**Not this RFC's:** staleness, retention, and measure bound *values* (quality
policy); board and queue layout and interaction (craft); the V1
reconciliation-gap computation (V1 RFC); streaming and control (deferred,
SDR-5).

## 6. Alternatives considered

Seven rejected alternatives are recorded in
`../../history/RFC-0008-history.md` §6. Two stay load-bearing for reading a
live clause. **Leaving the closure-without-merge state unnamed** was rejected
because a value the contract never names cannot be carried verbatim on a
machine answer (RFC6-14) or checked for parity, so implementations would spell
it `closed`, `abandoned`, or `done` with the disagreement release-blocking
under RFC6-22/23 — hence `closed-unmerged` is named in RFC8-12. **A composite
effort/health score with disclosed weights** was rejected *even disclosed*,
because weights are an opinion rendered as a measurement (RFC8-18).

## 7. Deliberately deferred — package-level

Per-module deferrals are in each module's §7. Two are stated here.

Physical schemas for plan items, queue records, materialization records, and
compaction records → RFC 0003.

Queue and board presentation, filters, and saved views → craft and personal
presentation state (VIS-6, exception (a)) — **with one obligation that does not
defer**: a board laid out as an ordered sequence of columns teaches that the
states form a monotone progress ladder, which RFC8-12's partition denies (the
terminal state is not the last rung, the four absence values are not rungs), so
any such layout **must place the terminal and absence values off the ladder,
not at the end of it**.

## 8. Owner questions — package index

Numbering is stable across the package and never shifts; each question's full
text lives in the module owning its clause, and answered items' full text and
reasoning are in `../../history/RFC-0008-history.md` §8.

| # | Subject | State | Lives in |
|---|---|---|---|
| q1 | Vocabulary closure (RFC8-12/13) | **answered — owner decision A8** | `state-vocabulary-and-cost.md` §8 |
| q2 | Queue realization (RFC8-7) | **open** | `identity-authority-materialization.md` §8 |
| q3 | Blocked-time cause split (RFC8-18) | **open** | `state-vocabulary-and-cost.md` §8 |
| q4 | Unknown-provenance visibility default (RFC8-23) | **open** | `accounting-reconciliation-and-release.md` §8 |
| q5 | Epistemic class of the normalized state (RFC8-12) | **answered — owner decision B14** | `state-vocabulary-and-cost.md` §8 |
| q6 | The "small" threshold on inherited mutations (RFC8-25) | **answered — owner decision B13** | `accounting-reconciliation-and-release.md` §8 |
| q7 | Unmapped-substrate-value rendering (RFC8-14) | **answered — owner decisions A5 / B15** | `state-vocabulary-and-cost.md` §8 |

## Phase boundary

The phase rule **RFC8-32** binds the whole package: this contract fixes the
semantics of the work surface and is not a specification of record from which
implementation work may be scheduled. The clause text is in
`accounting-reconciliation-and-release.md` §3.16, and its
clause-to-requirement coverage matrix must cover **RFC8-1…RFC8-31 across all
three modules**, not module 3 alone.

*End of RFC 0008 package index. Clauses RFC8-1 … RFC8-32 distributed across
three modules. No retired numbers, no merged numbers, no gaps in the range, and
no clause identity in more than one module.*
