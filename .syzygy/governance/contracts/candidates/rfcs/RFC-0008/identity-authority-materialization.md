# RFC 0008 — Trajectory (Work Surface): identity, authority, materialization

**Status:** Proposed foundational contract (self-declaration at authoring
time). Effective status is established solely by an owner-act record binding
this file's exact content digest — as an owner-adopted bootstrap act until the
independent A1 correlation mechanism exists, and as a Syzygy-verified effective
act only after correlation (RFC3-16). Absent such a record, this contract binds
nothing.

**Package:** module 1 of 3 of the RFC 0008 contract package. Index, clause map,
lookup rule, package-level integration and deferrals: `README.md`. Rationale,
amendment history, rejected alternatives, and answered §8 questions:
`../../history/RFC-0008-history.md`.

**Serves:** vision.md Thesis (three states; work is never proof), VIS-1, VIS-2,
VIS-6; architecture.md (typed authority; `work/`). Implements **owner rulings**
SDR-7, SDR-8, SDR-18, and the pre-materialization portion of the SDR §2
Trajectory charter.

## 0. Module scope and reader map (non-normative)

*If this section and a clause ever disagree, the clause wins.*

This module owns **what Trajectory is, what it may never become, what it is
made of, and who is authoritative at each stage of a work item's life**: the
three-plane rendering duty and the binding anti-thesis (RFC8-1/8-2), the
rebuildable-projection rule (RFC8-3), the ontology as a projection of RFC 0001
rather than a fork (RFC8-4/8-5/8-6), the approved-Proposal lifecycle and the
"What remains?" enumeration with its orphaned-work Contradiction and
exclusivity rules (RFC8-7/8-8), the SDR-18 ownership boundary against Polaris
(RFC8-9), and materialization as a one-way door with divergence rendered but
never adjudicated (RFC8-10/8-11). Read it to answer: *what work exists, under
whose authority, and which store is allowed to say so?*

Two rules carry most of the weight. **Trajectory never holds a second editable
store of a scheduler-owned field** (RFC8-2(a), RFC8-7, RFC8-11) — post-materialization
lifecycle state is read at the answering evaluation and re-derived, never
merged; capturing that a transition *occurred* is a different, permitted act.
And **a scheduler work item with no materialization record is a Contradiction,
not a badge** (RFC8-8, RFC8-10) — routed to owner adjudication as its only
lawful exit, never filtered, never absorbed as ordinary work.

The normalized work-state vocabulary this module's enumerations feed is
defined in module 2 (RFC8-12/8-13); the change-accounting chain that runs
through RFC8-10's materialization join is in module 3 (RFC8-21).

## 3. The contract

Clauses are numbered `RFC8-n` for stable citation. Amend in place; retire
rather than renumber.

### 3.1 Identity and plane discipline

**RFC8-1.** Trajectory renders all three state planes relevant to work —
desired (approved intent), execution (proposals-in-flight, work items, runs),
and observed (merge facts, verification evidence, reconciliation verdicts) —
**in one surface without letting any plane impersonate another** (RFC1-22/23).
Every rendered item carries its plane; an item whose plane cannot be
determined is counted and rendered Unknown, never omitted or guessed.

**RFC8-2.** **The anti-thesis is binding.** Trajectory must not be: (a) a
second editable store of any scheduler-owned field (RFC4-5, inward limb);
(b) a view in which scheduler closure renders as done, green, or complete
(RFC2-20); (c) a board showing current state that cannot answer "what did the
fleet change, at what cost, under whose authority" for a past window at the
fidelity the preserved records support.

**RFC8-3.** Trajectory is a **rebuildable projection** (VIS-6) over the kernel,
the `.syzygy/work/**` plane (RFC3-19), and the typed adapters — never
independently authoritative. Every mutation it offers is a synchronous,
attributed adapter or governance-plane act followed by a re-read (RFC4-5) —
never write-locally-and-sync-later.

### 3.2 Ontology: a projection of RFC 0001, not a fork

**RFC8-4.** Trajectory introduces **no new kernel entity**. Its ontology is a
projection of RFC1-5, with these bindings:

| Surface concept | Kernel identity (RFC 0001) |
|---|---|
| Candidate work / drafted plan | Proposal, kind *execution intent*, state drafted/under review (RFC1-27/31) |
| Approved plan / plan item | Approved execution-intent Proposal; decomposition via child Proposals (RFC1-30) |
| Materialization record | Materialization record (RFC1-29) |
| Work item (substrate alias "bead"), incl. epics | Work item, scheduler-issued, mirrored never minted (RFC1-5; RFC4-15) |
| Execution run / attempt | Execution run + its Execution Record (Evidence artifact, SDR-8; RFC4-18/19) |
| Review | Work item (review lane) + hosting PR facts as Evidence (RFC4-11) |
| Verification | Verification run — observed plane, never execution (RFC1-23; RFC4-13) |
| Reconciliation | Reconciliation evaluation and its verdict claim (RFC2-18) |
| Warrant | The `motivates` edge / a Decision — deliberately not reified (RFC1-8) |

**RFC8-5.** **Deliberate non-reifications**, recorded: an **idea** is personal
presentation state (VIS-6, exception (a)) until promoted into a Proposal —
never truth-bearing, never enumerated as work. A **milestone** is an
annotation-profile entity (RFC1-7), a lens for aggregation and compaction
boundaries, never itself work or a warrant. There is **no Feature entity**
(RFC1-32): "feature request" is intake vocabulary that must resolve to a
Capability identity before any status attaches. A **contradiction** and a
**dismissal** render here (as a blocker on a conclusion; as *dismissed by
decision*) but are never work items, never auto-scheduled (RFC1-21/20).

**RFC8-6.** A **compaction record** is a durable, identified record under
`.syzygy/work/**` (schema: RFC 0003) naming what it summarized, what it
discarded, and what remains externally queryable. It is a fact about
retention, never a status claim, and may never alter one (§3.13).

### 3.3 Pre-materialization authority and "What remains?"

**RFC8-7.** Trajectory renders the approved-Proposal lifecycle **drafted →
under review → approved → queued-for-materialization → materialized** over the
RFC1-28 entity, in RFC1-31's own state names.
`queued-for-materialization` is a **recorded queue act in `.syzygy/work/**` on
an approved Proposal** — not a new kernel lifecycle state and **never named
"scheduled"** (scheduling is typed-authority-routed to the work scheduler)
[Observed: architecture.md, typed authority]. The lifecycle terminates at
`materialized` (RFC1-29).

**Post-materialization withdrawal and supersession are scheduler lifecycle
state, and Syzygy never holds a mutable record of it.** They are **read from
the scheduler at the answering evaluation** (RFC4-15), **rendered against the
materialization record's join** (RFC8-10/8-11), stamped with that evaluation,
and discarded and re-derived at the next — never merged (RFC4-5, inward limb).
**No annotation, field, log, or appended entry recording post-materialization
scheduler state may be written onto the materialization record, and no
`.syzygy/work/**` transition may record it** — the record is immutable
(RFC1-29), a durable copy of a scheduler-owned mutable field is RFC8-2(a)'s
second editable store, and RFC8-11 forbids later correction, so such an
annotation could never be repaired once it diverged. Regret is expressed as a
**new Proposal citing the old one** (RFC1-31), not as a mutation of either
store.

**Capturing that a withdrawal or supersession *occurred* is permitted — and
required where a durable Syzygy record depends on the fact (RFC4-16(2)).** An
immutable, evaluation-stamped observation record or Execution Record noting
the transition as historical fact is captured evidence, not a mutable
projection (RFC4-5, inward limb, draws exactly this line): never rewritten,
never presented as the item's current lifecycle state, never joined into or
appended onto the materialization record, and not a `.syzygy/work/**`
**transition** — the prohibition is on Syzygy recording a lifecycle transition
*of its own*, not on the namespace, which houses Execution Records (RFC3-19).
What is forbidden is the second editable store of *current* scheduler state,
not beating the retention horizon: a transition lost to substrate GC before
capture renders **Unknown citing the retention event** (RFC4-16(3)), and
nothing here licenses that loss. [Inferred]

**RFC8-8.** **"What remains?" enumerates three planes, each labeled:**
(a) approved normative claims (requirements, governance clauses) covered by no
approved execution-intent Proposal — at V0 this is absence surfacing, not gap
computation [Observed: v1.md, V0/V1 gap boundary]; (b) approved execution
intent not yet materialized — from `.syzygy/work/**`, queue order visible;
(c) open materialized work items — from the scheduler read (RFC4-15) at the
answering evaluation, **each checked against the materialization record**
(RFC8-10). Drafted (unapproved) proposals render as *unadopted draft* (RFC2-25
sibling state) — enumerable, never counted among approved intent, never
anchoring any remaining-work total.

**Orphaned work is a Contradiction, not a badge.** A scheduler work item
matching **no materialization record** is an **orphaned-work Contradiction**
(RFC1-29, final paragraph): two stores answering one question, no pinned
intent revision for RFC2-18 to bind to, no warrant traceable through
`materializes`. Trajectory is the only surface enumerating scheduler work
items, so the obligation lands here: the enumeration **must** perform the
check, mint the Contradiction (RFC1-5/RFC1-18(b)), route it to **owner
adjudication as its only lawful exit** (RFC1-21; RFC2-15), render the affected
conclusion Unknown (reason #8 `contradicted-pending-adjudication`, `suspended`
tier), and render the finding itself — **never silently adopted into a record,
never silently deleted, never read as evidence that materialization happened**.
It is **exempt from filtering** (§8 q4). Re-materialization after a partial
failure must **cite and supersede the orphan finding** in the new record. An
orphaned work item is **not** Unknown-provenance and never renders as one
(RFC8-23).

**Exclusivity binds every enumeration and every total.** Every Proposal
declares an exclusivity group (RFC1-27). Trajectory's queue, its "what
remains" enumeration, and **every remaining-work total, count, or aggregate**
must never union — or sum across — two proposals in one exclusivity group, or
proposals whose compatibility is undeclared. The honest render is ***N
candidate futures*, selectable one at a time** (RFC1-27; VIS-1), carrying
RFC6-24's explicit scenario context; a context naming two members of one group
resolves `incompatible-scenario` (RFC6-5), never a merged scene and never a
summed count. Two approved exclusive proposals are **one** unit of remaining
work with two candidate shapes, never two — the drafted-proposal rule above
excludes only *drafts* and does not discharge this.

**RFC8-9.** Per SDR-18, **Trajectory owns the drafting queue and the work
lifecycle** — **an ownership asserted against Polaris, not against the work
scheduler**. Queue state, assignment, and progress live in this surface and
**Polaris renders that state read-only** (RFC7-24); Polaris owns the
contextual intent-authoring and adoption experience. Nothing here qualifies
architecture.md's typed-authority row: after materialization the **scheduler**
is authoritative for work lifecycle state (RFC8-10; RFC1-29), Trajectory
renders it and never stores it (RFC8-2/8-3). An intent-shaped queue item (a
spec or governance delta) renders in Trajectory's queue and adopts through
Polaris; the underlying Proposal and its state are one and the same in both
surfaces (RFC6-3).

### 3.4 Materialization rendering

**RFC8-10.** Materialization renders as a **one-way door** (SDR-7; RFC1-29):
the immutable materialization record — **proposal identity, work-item identity
set, and the pinned warranted intent revision** (RFC1-29; RFC1-5), all three
**required**, none conditional — is the join Trajectory walks in both
directions. The pinned revision is load-bearing: RFC2-18's verdict binds to
it, RFC8-21's chain runs through it, and RFC8-28's four-way distinction has
nothing to evaluate `reconciled@E` *against* without it. Trajectory
additionally renders the **materializing evaluation** alongside the record — a
Trajectory-side extension, not a kernel record component (§5). After
materialization the scheduler is authoritative for lifecycle state;
`.syzygy/work/**` plan state is never rendered as current for a materialized
item. **A missing record is a finding, not a silent skip:** a scheduler work
item matching no materialization record is the orphaned-work Contradiction,
handled per RFC8-8 — never absorbed as ordinary work, never treated as
evidence that materialization occurred. Until the record exists,
materialization has not occurred, whatever the scheduler holds (RFC1-29).

**RFC8-11.** **Divergence renders; Trajectory never adjudicates it.**
Substrate-side edits of Syzygy-written pointers (the warrant reference,
RFC4-17) render as substrate annotations ("edited in substrate at T; not a
warrant claim"): the `.syzygy/work/**` record stays authoritative, the pointer
is re-asserted at the next evaluation, and no contradiction is manufactured on
the chain's load-bearing join (RFC4-5, outward limb). Divergence between the
record and later scheduler state is a fact about the scheduler, never grounds
to rewrite the record (RFC1-29).

## 4. Violation cases

*Package numbering; cases are distributed to the module owning their clauses
and are never renumbered. Cases 4 and 12 span modules and are held in
`README.md` §4.*

1. *(RFC8-2/3)* A planning board stores an editable copy of scheduler status
   and syncs nightly; drag-to-column writes locally and reconciles later.
2. *(RFC8-7)* A `.syzygy/work/**` state named `scheduled`; a plan item edited
   after its materialization record exists; post-materialization supersession
   recorded as a `.syzygy/work/**` transition — **or appended to the
   materialization record as a `superseded_at` / `withdrawn_by` annotation**,
   which within months is a durable Syzygy-owned log of scheduler lifecycle
   transitions that RFC8-11 then forbids correcting.
3. *(RFC8-8)* "What remains" counts drafted proposals among approved intent,
   or omits items whose plane could not be determined.
11. *(RFC8-8/10)* A work item with no materialization record rendered as
    ordinary open work, or as an Unknown-provenance badge filtered off the
    board with only a count disclosed — no Contradiction minted, no
    adjudication route, the affected conclusion never rendered Unknown.

---

## 5. Integration — this module

**Relies on RFC 0001:** the closed entity/relation vocabulary RFC8-4 projects
(RFC1-5/25) and the warrant edge it deliberately does not reify (RFC1-8); the
annotation-profile entity behind *milestone* (RFC1-7); plan-item resolution and
one-way materialization including the orphaned-work Contradiction
(RFC1-28/29/30) and the pre-materialization lifecycle state names (RFC1-31);
exclusivity groups and *N candidate futures* (RFC1-27); plane assignment
(RFC1-22/23); no-Feature (RFC1-32); gap exits and adjudication-only
Contradiction exits (RFC1-20/21), with Contradiction minting per RFC1-18(b).
**RFC 0002:** the *unadopted draft* sibling state and the tier registry
(RFC2-25); the Unknown rendering of a conclusion suspended pending
adjudication (RFC2-15); scheduler closure never rendering as done (RFC2-20);
the reconciliation verdict that binds to RFC8-10's pinned intent revision
(RFC2-18). **RFC 0003:** `.syzygy/work/**` schemas for plan items, queue acts,
materialization records, Execution Records, and compaction records (RFC3-19).
**RFC 0004:** the two-limb anti-duplication invariant this module applies in
both directions (RFC4-5); the faithful scheduler feed read at the answering
evaluation (RFC4-15); capture-before-horizon and its declared maximum
inter-pass interval (RFC4-16, incl. RFC4-16(2)/(3)); Syzygy-written pointers
and their substrate-side edits (RFC4-17); hosting PR facts as Evidence
(RFC4-11); verification runs (RFC4-13); Execution Records (RFC4-18/19).
**RFC 0006:** the one-and-the-same Proposal across surfaces (RFC6-3); the
closed navigation-outcome set incl. `incompatible-scenario` (RFC6-5); explicit
singular scenario context (RFC6-24). **RFC 0007:** Polaris rendering queue
state read-only (RFC7-24).

**Foundation defect reported (not silently diverged from) — outstanding.**
**RFC1-28/31 omit the queued-for-materialization stage** of the owner-ratified
pre-materialization lifecycle (SDR-7 context). RFC8-7 realizes it as a recorded
work-plane fact on the approved Proposal, minting no kernel state; RFC 0001
should confirm that reading or add the state (§8 q2). Four further defects
reported against RFC 0001/0002 are **closed**; the trail is in
`../../history/RFC-0008-history.md` §5, and no RFC 0001 or RFC 0002 change is
outstanding on any of them.

**Extension flagged (not a defect).** RFC8-10 renders the **materializing
evaluation** alongside the materialization record. RFC1-29 and RFC1-5 name
three components and do not include it; it is a **Trajectory-side rendering
extension, not a kernel record component**, and this RFC does not add it to a
kernel-owned immutable record by assertion. RFC 0001 may adopt it as a fourth
component if the owner wishes; until then nothing binds on it.

**Provides to RFC 0007:** the SDR-18 boundary (RFC8-9) — drafting queue and
work lifecycle here, contextual intent authoring and adoption there.
**To RFC 0010:** the materialization join, the one-way-door rule, and the
orphaned-work Contradiction a Mission must respect before it may treat work as
authorized.

## 7. Deliberately deferred — this module

Physical schemas for plan items, queue records, materialization records, and
compaction records → RFC 0003. Queue and board presentation, filters, and
saved views → craft and personal presentation state (VIS-6, exception (a)),
subject to the non-deferring layout obligation in `README.md` §7. The
confirmation-path enumeration behind RFC1-21 → shared with RFC 0002; this RFC
renders the outcome, not the mechanism. Cross-project work views → portfolio
profile (SDR-29/30).

---

## 8. Owner questions

*Package numbering; question numbers never shift. Full package index:
`README.md` §8.*

2. **Queue realization (RFC8-7; §5 outstanding defect) — OPEN.** Confirm
   queued-for-materialization as a work-plane fact on the approved Proposal,
   or direct RFC 0001 to add it as a kernel lifecycle state.

---

*End of RFC 0008 module 1. Clauses RFC8-1 … RFC8-11, contiguous — no gaps,
nothing merged, nothing retired. Lettered limbs cited inside their parent
clauses (e.g. RFC8-2(a)–(c), RFC8-8(a)–(c)) are parts of those clauses — list
items within one clause body — not separate sub-clauses with their own
headings.*
