"""Generate TASK-ROUTER.md — the one current task router.

The router is **generated navigation, never authority**: it names, for each
task class, the directly governing clauses, the modules that own them, the
mandatory dependencies (read from module front matter, never hand-listed),
the applicable doctrine/craft rules, and the explicit omissions. It measures
nothing (the budget report owns measurement) and decides nothing (clauses
own their content).

Every route is validated at generation time:
  - every routed path exists in the tree;
  - every cited clause ID is defined in the module the route names;
  - every doctrine/craft identifier appears in its owning file;
  - deferred routes carry the deferred label.

Three routes are permanent regression fixtures (the launch-gate D2 tasks);
mutating any of them must fail --selftest.

Usage:
  python3 build_task_router.py            # (re)write TASK-ROUTER.md
  python3 build_task_router.py --check    # drift check, no write
  python3 build_task_router.py --selftest # mutation fixtures

#: final cell leads with `**Executed.**`, is disqualified: RD-53 proved that
#: the old whole-file anchor accepted P-6, P-7, P-13 and P-26 — all executed
#: — and rendered them under the words "each verified open".
#:
#: **This is now one function, not two identical ones.** It was duplicated
#: here with a comment saying the two copies must stay identical, which is
#: the same "maintained by hand in two places" defect this generator exists
#: to remove — and on 2026-08-13 both copies had to be patched for one bug.
#: `build_capability_1_views.open_decisions` is the single home; the three
#: limbs of its predicate are mutation-covered by that module's `--selftest`.
