"""Generate every Capability 1 view from CAPABILITY-1-CHARTER.yaml.

Owner charter §10: the Capability 1 route and the first-specification
sequence must not be independently maintained enumerations. One
machine-readable candidate planning charter is the source; five views are
generated from it and none is hand-edited:

    1. the Capability 1 task-router route      (build_task_router.py imports
                                                `route_payload()` from here)
    2. the first-specification sequence's behaviour rows
    3. the E3 trace-table skeleton
    4. the initial clause-coverage population
    5. the blocking-decision list

Views 2-5 are written to CAPABILITY-1-GENERATED-VIEWS.md, and view 2 is
also injected into FIRST-OPENSPEC-SEQUENCE.md between marker comments.

    build_capability_1_views.py            regenerate
    build_capability_1_views.py --check    fail on drift, write nothing
    build_capability_1_views.py --selftest mutation fixtures

WHY NO AUTHORITY HOME IS WRITTEN IN THE CHARTER. The charter names clause
IDs; every module path is *resolved* from the generated contract index. A
hand-written path is a fact with two homes (CC-REV-3) and the one place a
"wrong authority home" defect can hide, so the charter is not permitted to
carry one. `--selftest` mutates the index and confirms the resolution
notices.

Read-only except when regenerating. No network. Standard library only —
the repository does not vendor PyYAML, and the charter is written in the
same restricted subset the rest of the corpus's YAML uses (flow lists,
one level of block sequence), parsed strictly by `parse_charter`.
