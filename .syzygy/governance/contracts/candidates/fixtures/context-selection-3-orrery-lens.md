# Context-selection fixture 3 — Orrery architecture-lens change

## Task

**Objective.** A governed work item: draft the specification delta for a
change to an Orrery lens (adjusting what an existing V0 lens encodes on a
reserved channel). Risk class: encoding-meaning change — touches the
channel registry class (RFC9-26, an RFC3-16(a) artifact by example list),
but this task drafts the proposal; no adoption act occurs inside it.

**Warrant.** The named V0 lens and the reserved channel whose encoding
changes; the channel registry entry the change touches. Declared change
class: encoding-meaning proposal draft. The task performs no owner act and
authors no OpenSpec requirement — OpenSpec authoring for the adopted delta
is fixture 8's class, and the registry's adoption ceremony is a separate
packet (fixture 4's shape).

---

*Everything above the rule is the task. Everything below is the recorded
answer: a blind derivation (the protocol review RD-5 ran) receives the Task
section and the governed corpus only, derives a selection, and compares it
against what follows — reading no further until its own selection is
written down.*

**Selection rule trace (RFC11-4, traversal per RFC11-14).** Warrant names
the lens → `applies_to: orrery`, module `visual-grammar-and-lenses` +
package README (lens contract RFC9-31..35, channel contract RFC9-24..30).
Lenses render claim/Unknown states → RFC-0002 `rendering-vocabularies` +
README. The map's doctrine posture (VIS-7 trust floor, map scope amendment
D1) → `architecture.md`.

**Phase-boundary rule, applied (RFC11-4 with RFC11-13).** RFC-0009 and
RFC-0002 each declare `implementation_boundary: requires-openspec` (naming
RFC9-52 and RFC2-26); the declarations travel in the two loaded package
READMEs and are recorded here. This task drafts a proposal and does not sit
on the OpenSpec seam, so the boundary rule does not force RFC9-52's
defining module (`interaction-parity-and-release`); RFC2-26's defining
module (`rendering-vocabularies`) is in the packet on its own merits. When
the drafted delta reaches OpenSpec authoring, that packet — fixture 8's
class — loads the defining module.

## Required context (mandatory, deterministic)

```
scripts/context_load.py rfcs/RFC-0009/README.md \
  rfcs/RFC-0009/visual-grammar-and-lenses.md rfcs/RFC-0002/README.md \
  rfcs/RFC-0002/rendering-vocabularies.md doctrine:architecture.md
```

Measured: **15,271 words ≈ 20,616 estimated tokens.** Band position is
owned by `CONTEXT-BUDGET-REPORT.md` §1, computed from this anchored figure;
this fixture's prose makes no band claim of its own.

## Omitted applicable candidates, with reasons

- RFC-0009 `semantic-geography` — geography/anchoring/layout are
  untouched by a channel-encoding change; its clauses are not in the
  warrant's set. `interaction-parity-and-release` — parity obligations
  bind the implementation phase, and the boundary rule does not force the
  module for this off-seam draft (applied rule above).
- RFC-0002 core/challenge/reconciliation — rendering vocabulary suffices;
  evaluation machinery is pinned by the packet's as-of.
- RFC-0003 governance-homes — the proposal does not perform the
  registry's owner act; when the adoption ceremony becomes the task, that
  packet loads it (fixture 4's shape).
- RFC-0001/0004/0005/0006/0007/0008/0010/0011, `security.md`, craft — no
  kernel, evidence, client, or work surface touched.

## Why no applicable constraint was lost

The channel contract, reserved palette, lens conformance clauses, and both
selected contracts' implementation-boundary declarations (in their loaded
READMEs, recorded above) are all in the mandatory set; the registry's
authorization-bearing character is stated inside RFC9-26 itself (carried),
with the deeper RFC3-16(a) machinery deferred to the adoption task by the
applied rule. Performance and motion bounds (RFC9-49..51) live in the
omitted module 3 and load on demand (the README's package map names
RFC9-49's rule; RFC9-50..51 sit beside it) — the omission is safe because
the fixture's warrant does not alter frame or motion budgets.

## Suggested inferred additions (provenance: index adjacency)

RFC-0009 `interaction-parity-and-release` (non-3D equivalence for the
changed encoding — needed at surface-spec authoring, where it also carries
the package's phase-rule clause); RFC-0006 (drawer disclosure of encoded
facts).

## Packet digest

sha256 over the mandatory files concatenated in listed order:
`b906366a708d9c11…`.

**Selection: hand-authored golden selection. Measurement: mechanical.
Compiler implementation: absent.** `scripts/context_load.py` resolves a
path list it is handed and counts words; it has no notion of a task, a
warrant, a risk class, an `applies_to` value, or a dependency edge. The
selection above was made by a human and the trace is the reasoning that
produced it, written down — not a machine's output narrated afterwards.

*The `Compiler:`/`selection rules` line this fixture used to carry was
dropped rather than carried forward: there is no compiler, and
`rev10-fixtures` resolved to nothing in this repository — a version
identifier that names nothing is worse than none (the convention fixture 9
set). The digest and measurement above are written by
`scripts/build_budget_report.py` and independently recomputed by
`scripts/check_governance.py` CG-18; neither figure is transcribed.*

*Re-measured 2026-08-05b by `scripts/check_governance.py` CG-18, which recomputes the digest and the word count from the declared mandatory set rather than trusting the recorded figures. Previous: 14,134 words, digest `2e408eaf40278ca7…`. Selection unchanged; the movement is contract edits landing under a fixture that had no mechanical freshness check until now.*

*Restructured 2026-08-08 (round-2026-08d): task/answer boundary added per
RD-5's blind-derivation protocol; phase-boundary rule applied under amended
RFC11-4/RFC11-13; transcribed measurements removed — the anchored
`Measured:` field and the packet digest are the only measurements this
fixture states.*

*Re-measured 2026-08-10 by the same CG-18 method (declared mandatory set, listed order): the round-2026-08e RD-26 repair batch edited Wave A modules this packet loads. Previous: 15,193 words, digest `0a7756d0c5228cdd…`. Selection unchanged; the movement is contract repairs landing under the fixture, which is the class this check exists to catch.*

*Re-measured 2026-08-10b by the same CG-18 method: the round-2026-08e RD-27 repair batch edited Wave B modules this packet loads. Previous: 15,236 words, digest `e747219328d5cb2b…`. Selection unchanged.*
