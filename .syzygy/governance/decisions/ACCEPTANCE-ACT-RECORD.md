# Acceptance-act record

> **The record of performed owner acts** over the final pre-specification
> package, created at the first act per
> `contracts/candidates/FINAL-FOUNDATIONAL-CONTRACT-ACCEPTANCE-RECORD.md`
> §2 step 4. Entries are appended, dated, and never edited. Each entry is
> an **owner-adopted bootstrap act** under RFC3-16(c)'s two-state model:
> a governance fact preserved as phrase + exact digest + commit/tag,
> **"owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)" — never "verified"** — until

## Act A — Wave A accepted, 2026-08-17

**Phrase, exactly as written by the owner (in-interaction, 2026-08-17):**

```
ACCEPT FOUNDATIONAL WAVE A: 8972d9630b95f5d4266432dbb1b3602114576bbd6c0f29d6f9bd6f905b1f884a
```

| | |
|---|---|
| Argument | sha256 of `contracts/candidates/wave-manifests/WAVE-A-MANIFEST.txt`, verified equal to the phrase at the act |
| Accepts | the 19 modules of RFC 0001–0006 at the per-module digests in that manifest |
| Confirmation | RD-31b, `VERDICT: CONFIRM`, on this exact argument (2026-08-10; raw at `contracts/candidates/round-2026-08e/reviews/RD-31b-wave-a-RAW.md`) |
| Ceremony verification (step 2) | `sha256sum -c` — 19 of 19 rows OK from the candidates root; `build_active_manifest.py --check` — manifests match regeneration; manifest digest equals the phrase argument `[Observed, this act]` |
| Install (step 3, shape (M) per the P-33 ruling) | the 19 modules copied to `.syzygy/governance/contracts/rfcs/` with their package structure, **and nothing else** — no companions, neither manifest. Verified: `sha256sum -c candidates/wave-manifests/WAVE-A-MANIFEST.txt` run from `.syzygy/governance/contracts/`, 19 of 19 OK; the installed tree holds exactly 19 files |
| Disclosed at the act | the 88 dangling path strings across the installed waves resolve in the candidates tree, not beside the installed copies — the (M) ruling's disclosed property (`WAVE-A-INSTALL-SHAPE-DECISION.md`); §7's Wave-A riders ride in as recorded there |
| Commit / tag (step 5) | the commit carrying this entry and the installed tree; annotated tag `wave-a-accepted-2026-08-17` |

Effective status of the 19 modules for human governance: **accepted —
owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)**. Constraints bind at full
strength; nothing consumed as an authorization-for-effect satisfies
RFC3-16(a) from this record alone.

## Act B — Wave B accepted, 2026-08-17

**Phrase, exactly as written by the owner (in-interaction, 2026-08-17,
after the Wave A act — the A → B ordering is satisfied):**

```
ACCEPT FOUNDATIONAL WAVE B: 193e3c1e15e4b1375f938d62c9e8c1a442984313e0794ada5965d2cdf9d7e3ed
```

| | |
|---|---|
| Argument | sha256 of `contracts/candidates/wave-manifests/WAVE-B-MANIFEST.txt`, verified equal to the phrase at the act |
| Accepts | the 11 modules of RFC 0007–0009 (Polaris, Trajectory, Orrery) at the per-module digests in that manifest |
| Confirmation | RD-32c, `VERDICT: CONFIRM`, on this exact argument (2026-08-10; raw at `contracts/candidates/round-2026-08e/reviews/RD-32c-wave-b-RAW.md`) |
| Ordering | performed **after** the Wave A act (Act A above), so every RFC 0001–0006 reliance in these modules resolves into **accepted** text — the acceptance record row B's performed-alone caveat never triggered |
| Ceremony verification (step 2) | `sha256sum -c` — 11 of 11 rows OK from the candidates root; `build_active_manifest.py --check` — manifests match regeneration; manifest digest equals the phrase argument `[Observed, this act]` |
| Install (step 3, shape (M) per the P-33 ruling) | the 11 modules copied to `.syzygy/governance/contracts/rfcs/` with their package structure, **and nothing else**. Verified: `sha256sum -c candidates/wave-manifests/WAVE-B-MANIFEST.txt` run from `.syzygy/governance/contracts/`, 11 of 11 OK; the installed tree holds exactly the 30 files of Waves A + B |
| Disclosed at the act | the (M) dangling-path property (Act A above) extends over these modules; the installed-tree class is reported by `check_governance.py` CG-1i |
| Commit / tag (step 5) | the commit carrying this entry and the installed modules; annotated tag `wave-b-accepted-2026-08-17` |

Effective status of the 11 modules for human governance: **accepted —
owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)**. Constraints bind at full
strength; nothing consumed as an authorization-for-effect satisfies
RFC3-16(a) from this record alone.

## Acts 6 and 7 — the CC-SPEC and CC-IMPACT craft amendments confirmed, 2026-08-17

**Phrases, exactly as written by the owner (in-interaction, 2026-08-17,
one sitting — the two policies are one model and were offered jointly):**

```
CONFIRM CRAFT AMENDMENT: CC-SPEC@9889b7e311ad941eec84d01dc2c035c7e2502a57cf18e68a1028a76d5b814871

| Confirms | **CC-SPEC-1…11** (the specification-acceptance standard) and **CC-IMPACT-1…7** (the shape-to-spec impact rule) as owner-confirmed craft policy, in force at those digests |
| Review chain | RD-51 `REVISE` → repair → RD-69 `REVISE` (one blocker, repaired same day) → **RD-70 `CONFIRM WITH EXCEPTIONS`** on these digests (raw + register: `contracts/candidates/round-2026-08i/reviews/`) |
| Disclosed at the act | the nine open non-blocking findings (RD-69 N1–N5, RD-70 N1–N4) travel into force, per the offering packets — the first post-act amendment's worklist |
| Recording | `policies/craft-and-care/INSTALL-RECORD.md` (the act-2 precedent); the files bind at their committed home, uncopied and unedited — an edit after the act retires it |
| What this changes | launch-gate **E5** and **E6** now have owner-confirmed, citable owners; the first specification, when the owner authorizes authoring, is judged under a standard in force |
| Commit / tag (step 5) | the commit carrying this entry; annotated tag `craft-acts-6-7-confirmed-2026-08-17` |

Effective status for human governance: **confirmed craft policy —
owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)**.

## General trusted-bootstrap authorization transaction — performed 2026-09-01

All five rows below were performed together. Their wording is copied exactly
from the transaction-bound `ACT-SEMANTICS.md`.

| # | Act type | Stable subject identity | Exact digest(s) | Scope | Supersession / revocation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `accept-contract-amendment` | accepted RFC 0001-0009 contract set | contract-amendment manifest `480c06d79f237f3a8d18d40a3de97e772a2da70db6cf976578eeab5c177cc4b1` | Accept the generalized effective-owner-act model: valid state (1) and state (2) acts may satisfy existing owner gates, exact state always renders, invalid acts fail closed, and acts remain warrants rather than evidence | Supersedes the current bytes accepted through the historical Wave A/B acts; those acts, manifests and prior bytes remain immutable historical evidence |
| 2 | `sign-off-coverage-amendment` | Capability 1 change `project-registration-and-honest-shape-visibility`, `CONTRACT-COVERAGE.md` only | `15431d8ba1fe25a61e4dc2713c4d51fad1cf6d25ef7a9103cc616265102289c9` | Reconcile contract traceability to the amended RFC3-16 model; change no requirement, proposal, design or implementation authorization | Supersedes only that artifact's digest in the 2026-08-20 adoption; all other adopted digests remain |

| 5 | `confirm-craft-amendment` | in-force policy `SPECIFICATION-ACCEPTANCE-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md` (CC-SPEC-1..11) | `6093dbbe519dad6c35a5aaeeb31355d2e435d76ec4f0c2c9affb0d1e5b6b5621` | Amend CC-SPEC-8's reviewed-N/A owner-act gate to accept valid state (1) or state (2), render the exact state, and fail closed on absent or invalid acts; no other craft obligation changes | Supersedes the policy digest confirmed by craft act 6; that performed act, digest and prior bytes remain immutable historical evidence |

Effective status: the amended contract set, seven amended coverage artifacts
and CC-SPEC amendment are **owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)** at the
exact scopes and digests above. State (1) is effective but never supports the
claim “independently verified”; owner acts remain warrants, not evidence.

Apart from row 5's CC-SPEC amendment, this transaction grants no
effect-specific consent or policy approval, registry adoption, observation,
write, egress, execution, deployment, release, recovery, implementation or
mission authority. It does not accept RFC 0010 or RFC 0011, amend doctrine,
sign Mission Control behavior, implement PWB or start automatic follow-on
work.

## PWB state-(1) amendment — performed 2026-09-02

Effective status: the eleven-artifact PWB package is **signed behavioral
authority — owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)**. Valid state (1) and state
(2) human acts may satisfy PWB-REQ-005 and PWB-REQ-022; only state (2) is
independently verified. Invalid acts fail closed and acts remain warrants, not
success evidence.

This act grants no effect-specific consent or policy approval, registry
adoption, repository-body read, write, egress, execution, deployment, release,
recovery, implementation or mission authority. Separate effect-specific acts
and separate PWB implementation authorization remain open.

unchanged.

This act approves no policy, adopts no registry entry, widens no consent and
authorizes no implementation of the amended semantics. Decisions 2 and 3 of

The other effect authorities and the continuation of PWB implementation
authorization remain separate; no body read, write, egress, execution,
deployment, release, recovery or mission authority follows from this act.

# Polaris understanding specification amendment adoption

Owner: Tzeusy

Act instant: 2026-09-13T01:58:26Z

Project identity: project:syzygy

Artifact identity: specification:syzygy:polaris-generation:understanding-amendment

Act type: adopt specification amendment

Provenance: owner-adopted (bootstrap, uncorrelated)

A1 audit-record identity: explicitly absent

Owner instruction, recorded verbatim: “Adopt it”

The instruction refers to the reviewed formal amendment offered immediately
before it. The manifest below binds its exact eight-file subject and retained
review/context hashes. This recorder-generated binding is not presented as a
longer phrase typed by the owner:

ADOPT POLARIS UNDERSTANDING AMENDMENT: 3f4b96956b85a268532521ee5d0b1212d28537af7fddf09f89c877bd54bbc40d

Manifest: docs/evidence/polaris-understanding-adoption-manifest-2026-09-13.json

Scope: adopt the specification amendment at the manifest's exact bytes.
REQ-polaris-generation-002, 004, 006, 009, 012, 014 and 019 take their full
amended clauses and preserved scenarios; 030 and 031 are added. The other 22
predecessor requirements remain unchanged. Effective composition is 31
requirements and 177 scenarios, not an implementation completion verdict.

Supersession relationship: partial specification amendment to the subject of
POLARIS-GENERATOR-SPECIFICATION-ADOPTION-ACT.md. Only the seven named requirement
blocks are superseded by their extended blocks; the predecessor remains in force
for its unchanged requirements and is preserved byte-for-byte.

Revocation relationship: none. Existing implementation and applicability acts
retain their own exact scopes. This act grants no implementation extension,
source/provider/content permission, write consent, deployment or release.

Adoption leaves the reviewed files and their candidate-era banners unchanged.
The act record determines effective status. This is bootstrap owner provenance,
not independent authorship verification, runtime evidence or product readiness.

# Contract readability restyle adoption

Act instant: 2026-09-28T01:42:56Z

Project identity: project:syzygy

Artifact identity: contract:syzygy:rfc-0001-0009:readability-restyle

Act type: adopt contract amendment (successor to the general trusted-bootstrap contract manifest)

ADOPT CONTRACT READABILITY RESTYLE: 6e83675fd61bf72a1912152dbc3c6dda64303e892eeadcf1273ce6aebe6ab134
```

The argument is the sha256 of .syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/contract-readability-restyle/CONTRACT-AMENDMENT-MANIFEST.txt. It was recomputed at recording,
matched the phrase, and equals the reviewed digest the recorder pins.

Confirming review: docs/reviews/R-TREE-STYLE-CONTRACT-PACKAGE-1-RAW.md (sha256 3a6121085b8cc53f060d70c325412420c627aff92bf831d45bce32ad570a150d)

The manifest binds the exact post-restyle bytes of 29 of the 30 accepted
RFC 0001-0009 modules, every one except rfcs/RFC-0007/rendering-and-surface.md.

Scope: readability restyle only. Clause identities, clause leads, front
matter and headings are unchanged by construction (the package builder
verifies all three); the installed and candidate mirrors take the same bytes.

Supersession relationship: link 2 of the contract successor chain. For its 29
paths it supersedes the current-byte rows of the general trusted-bootstrap
contract manifest, and of any earlier performed chain link, which remain
preserved as act-time history. RFC-0007's rendering module stays bound where
it was.

Revocation relationship: none. This act grants no implementation, source,
provider, write, deployment or release permission.

This is bootstrap owner provenance, not independent authorship verification,
runtime evidence or product readiness.

The argument is the sha256 of .syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/spec-policy-readability-restyle/SPEC-POLICY-AMENDMENT-MANIFEST.txt. It was recomputed at recording,

The recorder derived one craft-amendment line per manifest row. They are not
words the owner typed; they name each policy's confirmed digest:

```

Scope: readability restyle of CC-SPEC-1…11 and CC-IMPACT-1…7, plus the
status-banner corrections disclosed in the package's decision packet. Clause
leads, headings and identifiers are unchanged by construction (the package
builder verifies all three). CC-IMPACT-7's fixture pin is unchanged.

Supersession relationship: each policy's current bytes are bound by its row
above. The act-6, act-7 and transaction-row digests remain preserved as
act-time history.

Revocation relationship: none. This act grants no implementation, source,

Scope: readability restyle of the Polaris generator proposal and design, with present-tense status in place of pre-adoption candidate language. The specification, every contract document and the other bound sources are unchanged, and the understanding amendment's overlay is untouched. Every requirement, scenario and warrant block is
unchanged; the successor tool verifies that structure.

Supersession relationship: each subject is bound by its successor digest
above. Earlier acts and their digests are preserved as act-time history.

Revocation relationship: none. This act widens no implementation authority
and grants no source, provider, write, deployment or release permission.

This is bootstrap owner provenance, not independent authorship verification,
runtime evidence or product readiness.
