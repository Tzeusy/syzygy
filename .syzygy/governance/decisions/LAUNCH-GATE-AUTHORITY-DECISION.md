## Question

Approve `launch-gate-pre-specifications.md` **v2.0** as this repository's
owner-approved **process policy** for evaluating pre-specification
readiness?

## What the policy governs

```text
the question set (A1–A6, B1–B5, C1–C7, D1–D4, E1–E6, F1–F6, G1)
the administration protocol — materials, order, who may administer
the closed verdict vocabulary
the verdict formula and its two pass branches
the launch-scope parameters (§8)
the structured administration record and its generated report
the trend log
```

## What it never governs

```text
whether specifications are authored          — that is your launch decision
the content of any artifact under judgment   — the gate judges, it does not author
any acceptance, adoption, or approval        — no verdict is an act (VIS-4)
```

A `READY` verdict authorizes nothing. It is evidence you may weigh when
making a separate launch decision, and a gate administered under an
approved policy is worth exactly as much as the administration behind it.

## What you would be binding

| Artifact | sha256 |
|---|---|
| `launch-gate-pre-specifications.md` (v2.0) | `05ecaa954e81ef95f6e2e2b409fbcb5bd5391037c10d9624ab4af3217a00f6d2` |
| `launch-gate-administration.schema.json` | `e0167fb8af6a903c527d402d56c4fb85ebdfed9608de1a485f4f1563aa6a69fb` |

Verify before acting — the digest belongs to the artifact, not to this
page:

```sh
# from the repository root — both artifacts live there, and this packet
# does not. Run from anywhere else and you get "No such file or directory",
# which reads like a missing artifact rather than a wrong directory.
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
sha256sum launch-gate-pre-specifications.md launch-gate-administration.schema.json
```

## What changed at v2.0, in five lines

The administration record stops being Markdown. It is JSON validated
against the schema above; the human report is generated from it and never
read back as authority; the verdict is computed and the schema **rejects** a
claimed one. §1, §3, §4 and §8 of the instrument are **byte-identical** to
v1.18 — no question's text moved, the formula is unchanged, and the
parameter block still binds. Full record of every change of meaning:
`../contracts/candidates/round-2026-08f/LAUNCH-GATE-v2.0-SEMANTIC-DELTA.md`.

**Why a format change rather than another fix:** thirteen consecutive
independent re-reviews of the Markdown record format each found a real
defect, and each repair minted the next. The chronology is
`launch-gate/HISTORY.md` and you do not need it to decide this.

## Independent review verdicts

> **Two reviews are required before this decision is offerable, and
> neither has been obtained.** The owner charter (§5.6, §14) commissions a
> policy-semantics review — *did v2.0 weaken any readiness question or
> formula?* — and a structured-record review — *can malformed or
> contradictory data produce a false READY, and does the generated report
> faithfully present the canonical record?*
>
> **Status 2026-08-11: not dispatched.** The authoring session could not
> spawn reviewer agents (no pane space in the terminal it runs in) and did
> not confirm its own bytes instead. This packet is therefore **prepared,
> not offered**, and the row below is honest rather than empty.

| Review | Subject | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Policy semantics | v2.0 instrument | `[Unknown]` — not dispatched |
| Structured record | schema, validator, renderer | `[Unknown]` — not dispatched |

## Known residuals

Carried from the delta's disclosed limits — each measured, none
generalized:

1. The validator reads the instrument's own §8 prose in **one** place, to
   bind E4's fixed cases. Bounded and fail-closed, and disclosed rather
   than claimed absent.
2. The JSON Schema interpreter is a documented **subset**. Its safety
   property is that it rejects any keyword it does not implement; it is not
   the reference implementation.
3. Presence tests on free-text fields are **content-blind** by design. A
   reviewer who writes a plausible false evidence quote defeats this tool,
   and no version of it has claimed otherwise.
4. **No administration has been performed under v2.0.** The verdict path is
   fixture-proven, not field-proven.
5. F5 (assurance independence) is **not** a conjunct of the formula. Every
   administration so far has been by the corpus authors' model family.
   Promoting F5 to a conjunct is an owner option — see below.

## Your options

**(a) Approve v2.0 as process policy.** Recommended `[Inferred]` **only
after** the two reviews above return. The instrument becomes the standard a
formal administration is run under.

**(b) Approve with F5 promoted to a conjunct.** Same as (a), plus: a
`Not met` F5 blocks a READY verdict. This would block a pass on any
administration run by this corpus's own model family — the strictest
available reading of assurance independence, and a real constraint on who
can administer the gate.

**(c) Amend first.** Name what to change; the change travels as a semantic
delta and a v2.1 entry, and the two reviews re-run on the changed bytes.

**(d) Decline.** The gate stays a candidate. Administrations remain
evidence you may weigh; no formal administration can be said to have been
run under approved policy, and the readiness standard's "launch-gate
v2.0 is owner-approved" conjunct stays unsatisfied.

## The lawful transaction

There is no ceremony phrase for this decision and none is needed — it is a
recorded owner decision, not a digest-binding act. To approve, record in
this file, dated and signed in your own words:

```text
APPROVED — launch-gate v2.0 as process policy
instrument sha256: <the digest you verified>
schema sha256:     <the digest you verified>
F5 promoted to a conjunct: yes / no
```

Then the queue row P-34 closes, and the formal administration becomes
runnable — by a reviewer outside this corpus's model family, or a human,
which is a requirement of the instrument and not of this packet.

## Earliest required gate

Before the **formal launch administration**. Not before the Wave A or Wave
B acts: the contract acts do not depend on this policy, and this policy
does not gate them.
