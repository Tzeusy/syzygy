"""The keep-or-remove rule of syzygy-bpyt.4.31, applied to every census site. Evidence tool, not authority.

usage: python3 -I docs/evidence/syzygy-bpyt-4-31/tools/decide.py CENSUS.json SITE-DURATIONS.json CI-DURATIONS.json CITED.json OUT.json

The rule takes syzygy-bpyt.4.13's threshold (scripts/size_vitest_test_timeouts.py): half the default the site would fall back
to, 2500 ms for a test (testTimeout 5000) and 5000 ms for a hook (hookTimeout 10000). A site is

  cited     when its reason already cites a commit or retained record, or CITED.json names one, that measured it above the
            threshold (or saw it time out at the default); its reason is made to cite that;
  blocked   when its file is one an open pull request changes (CITED.json `blocked`); it is left as it is;
  remove    when the fresh local runs measured it (at least 5 observations, every run passed) at or under the threshold AND every
            hosted run listed bounds it there too: for a test, its slow-test line (or no line, which means under 300 ms) in a
            run where its file ran; for a hook, its file's duration less the slow tests listed beneath it;
  keep      otherwise, citing whichever measurement exceeded the threshold, or, when no measurement exceeds it but a host does
            not bound it, the record that shows the gap. Hosted runs print no hook time: a file's duration less its slow tests
            bounds its hooks from above, and that less 300 ms for every other test bounds them, together, from below.
            A config's hookTimeout also governs every beforeEach and afterEach hook, which runs inside a test's duration: it is
            removed only when its tier's worst test is at or under the hook threshold.

A removal still has to pass 5 of 5 full-file runs at the head, each again at or under the threshold, before it lands."""
