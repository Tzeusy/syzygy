"""Join the census runs, the tracer's logs and the static site census into one record of every scratch prefix.

Usage: assemble_census.py <worktree> <commit> <static-sites.json> <runs-directory> <probe-directory> <out.json>
       assemble_census.py --selftest <out.json>

<runs-directory> holds, for each label, <label>.json (census_run.py's record), <label>.trace.jsonl.gz and <label>.samples.json, as
collect_runs.py writes them, and three files that name what the run records do not: sampler-digests.json ({"sha256": {label: sha256 of
<label>.samples.json}}, written by `collect_runs.py --digest-existing`), carried-observations.json (facts read once from directories
that no longer exist) and optionally operator-notes.json ({label: [text, ...]}). Every run must name <commit>, and so must the static
census. <probe-directory> must not exist or be empty and be a short absolute path: the assembler runs `npx vitest --version` there once,
to record which entries the launcher alone leaves in a temp directory, and removes what it made there when it is done.

What a name is: a name the trace logged as created by mkdtemp is classed by its prefix (the pid and namespace digits of an owner-pid
name replaced by <pid> and <ns>); a name the trace logged as a mkdir or file creation is a fixed name, or a derived name when it
starts with a mkdtemp name of the same run; a name no trace line covers is classed by shape: a Chrome singleton directory, a
21-character vitest project directory (not a `<word>-<6>` mkdtemp name), npm's compile cache, or else unattributed. Dispositions come
from RULES below, first match wins; a class that matches none stops the assembler.

The aggregation (classes, the rule table, the exposure bounds, the partition sentence) is in functions above the self-test, so that
--selftest runs the same code over a synthetic two-run fixture whose expected answer is written as literals here, then over mutants of
this file (one predicate changed in each), and requires every mutant to fail.
