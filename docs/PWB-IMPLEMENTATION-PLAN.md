Every substantive statement below is `[Inferred]` planning unless marked
`[Observed]`; the spec's own oracles decide, never this plan.

## 1. Stack and packaging

**No new language, package, runtime dependency or route.** `[Observed]` The
adopted registry entry names the implementation module as
`packages/three-surface-poc-core/src/project-shape-observer.ts` inside the
existing `three-surface-poc-core` package, so no `tsc -b` project list or
Vitest project entry changes. TypeScript on Node ≥22.15, Vitest, `tsc -b
--force` for `build:poc`, exactly as today.

- **Markdown and TOML are parsed by small, inert, purpose-built line
  parsers** in this repository rather than a third-party Markdown library.
  The extraction grammar (spec "Reader definitions") is literal: H2/H3
  headings, top-level list items, table body rows, a leading bold or code
  span, one `[butler].name` key. A general Markdown parser would both widen
  the attack surface (raw HTML, link resolution) and make the grammar harder
  to falsify. The parser never produces HTML; it produces typed items and
  NFC-normalized strings.
- **Git objects only.** Bodies are read through `git cat-file --batch` /
  `git ls-tree -r -l <revision>` against the configured repository's
  resolved Git common directory, never through the working tree, and only for
  paths admitted by the read guard (§4). `[Observed]` `code-structure.ts`
  already uses `ls-tree` metadata this way with an injectable `runGit`.
- **One shared model, parity by construction.** `PocModel` gains additive
  fields (§5); `GET /api/poc` stays `JSON.stringify(model)`; all Polaris
  HTML renders from that object.

P1 deviation, recorded 2026-09-03: `authority-disclosure.ts` landed in
`packages/three-surface-poc-core/` rather than the app so the machine channel
inherits the strings by construction, and the field extraction split out into
`authority-artifact-fields.ts`.

P2.1 note, recorded 2026-09-03: `git-tree.ts` was split out because the
manifest (2.1) and the exact-object reader (2.3) share tree metadata. The
manifest's index-link grammar is a closed rule under
`pwb-discovery-v1-candidate.3`: inline links and reference definitions
outside fenced blocks and code spans; a pillar root is a root-index link
whose directory basename is one of the five pillar keys; a pillar index
names only files under its own root; images, external, escaping, directory
and self links are recorded as ignored. Extraction classes are assigned by
(rule, pillar, path within root). `[Unknown]` whether the real Butlers
indexes fit this grammar — §9 already routes that to the first P4 live run.

P2.2 note, recorded 2026-09-03: the phase A observer landed as its own
module, `project-shape-observation.ts`, rather than inside the registry-named
`project-shape-observer.ts`, so the P1 gate file (and its 86-site mutation
denominator) stays byte-stable; the gate composes it through `read`, and the
test proves a non-admitting authority issues zero Git calls. The observer
resolves the revision to an exact commit, takes the committer instant from
Git metadata as the source-claimed instant PWB-REQ-001 wants kept distinct
from capture, and admits every seed read against the tree before it happens
(root index or pillar `README.md` only, tree-matching object id, regular blob
mode; symlinks and submodules are refused, over-limit seeds are not opened).
Returned bytes are verified against Git's own blob identity before use. The
production `gitRunnerFor` binding exists but nothing in `main.ts` calls it:
no Butlers read happens before P4.

P2.3 note, recorded 2026-09-04: `git-object-reader.ts` is the phase B
read guard and reader. It never reuses phase A's `readSeed` (the phase A
seed allowlist is narrower and already act-tested), but both share
`git-tree.ts` metadata and the P2.2 `GitRunner`, `gitBlobObjectId` and
`ResourceLimitBreach` shapes. Decisions: (a) the caller's path must already
be normalized — a traversal-shaped path that would resolve inside the tree
is refused as `path-not-normalized`, never silently rewritten; (b) the only
Git command the reader issues is `cat-file blob <object-id>` taken from the
tree entry, never a path-addressed read; (c) the policy's denied
basename/prefix/suffix rules are compared case-insensitively on the final
segment (strictly more refusals); (d) active content is scanned with the
2026-09-05 policy amendment's Markdown code-context mask
(`markdown-code-context.ts`, profile `closed-pwb-code-context-v1`): bytes
wholly inside a closed inline code span or fenced code block are inert for
active-form detection only — secret detectors always scan the raw text — and
one finding outside those contexts, or a malformed context (unclosed fence
or span, backtick fence with a backtick in its info string, reported as the
form `malformed-code-context`), excludes the whole source with a body-free
finding (form, line, column); (e) `evaluateLimit` is the one comparison for all six
registry limits, so index depth (observer), parse time (2.5) and rendered
bytes (2.7/3.x) breach in the same shape as source count and bytes; (f)
`readManifestSources` returns one result per manifest source in manifest
order and hands each body only to the caller's `consume` callback, so no
record this module returns can carry a body. Still no Butlers read: the
reader is constructed by nothing before P4.

P2.4 note, recorded 2026-09-04: `content-classification.ts` is the policy's
six-step `classificationOrder` executed over the P2.3 reader's transient
body. Decisions: (a) the policy is a parameter — `PWB_SECRET_POLICY` is the
hard-coded copy proven byte-equal to the act-bound JSON, detectors are
compiled from the policy document's own strings (an uncompilable policy
throws rather than screening nothing), and every exclusion names the
policy version it ran under; (b) every detector runs over each body and the
first match in policy order is the one named, so a later detector's failure
cannot hide behind an earlier match; (c) three outcomes, all body-free:
`classified` (text handed to the extractor's callback only),
`excluded` (an RFC5-17 hash-not-body record in one of the two emitted
redaction classes) and `unavailable` (missing, non-blob, unreadable — the
policy never saw a body, so it is not an exclusion but stays counted with the
registry's `source-uncaptured-or-unreachable`); (d) a denied path is an
`excluded-artifact` exclusion with reason `denied-path` and no content digest,
because the body was never read; (e) a resource-limit breach is the policy's
`unclassifiable-excluded` exclusion, but its Unknown reason follows the
registry's `someSourcesUncapturedOrOverLimit` mapping (`Partial snapshot`,
`source-uncaptured-or-unreachable`) rather than the policy's blanket
`excluded-content` — the two act-bound artifacts differ here and the
registry is the adapter's declared error mapping (RFC4-2 item 6), so it wins
for the reason while the policy wins for the exclusion record; (f) parse
failure (step 5) is exposed as `parseFailureExclusion` for the extractor to
call, since only 2.5 knows when a parse failed. Still no Butlers read.

Authority-boundary repair, recorded 2026-09-05: the launcher now rejects any
resolved locator other than the consent record's configured Butlers locator,
and rejects a Git common directory other than that locator's exact object
database, before constructing the shared model. Governance inputs and
lifecycle records are loaded from the already-observed exact Syzygy commit;
recording tags resolve only when their act-record blob is byte-equal to that
current-tree record, and lifecycle enumeration/read/decode failures abort the
loader rather than producing an empty lifecycle. Phase-A root and pillar
indexes run the approved secret detectors and active-content screen before
their text reaches link parsing; an excluded seed remains counted Unknown and
derives no child paths. These changes repair PWB-LIVE-01/08/09 without changing
the consent, policy vocabulary, signed behavior, or state-(1) disclosure.

P2.5 note, recorded 2026-09-04: `project-shape-extraction.ts` implements the
spec's "Reader definitions" literally, one function per item class, over the
classified text 2.4 hands to its consumer. Decisions: (a) the parsers are
inert line parsers of the plan's own making — ATX headings, column-0 list
items, pipe tables with a required delimiter row, a leading bold or code
span, a Markdown link, and one `[butler].name` key — fenced code blocks are
masked, CRLF is tolerated, and nothing is rendered or resolved; (b) identity
is `(class, key)` with the path and 1-based line as anchor state, keys and
statements are NFC-normalized and nothing else (heading text, levels,
top-level depth, column counts and label positions are matched exactly);
(c) the six `project-account-section` keys are `purpose`, `promises`,
`refusals` (vision.md), `architecture` (every H2 of architecture.md
concatenated) and `v1-scope`, `v1-success` (v1.md); success criteria are
keyed `vision:<n>` / `v1:<n>`; topology components `<H2 ordinal>:<label>`;
catalog entries by their leading bold/code label, which must be followed by
a dash; craft policies by the File-column link target's basename; baseline
specs and roster identities by their tree directory; (d) any grammar
failure — closed vocabulary `unsupported-source`, `missing-heading`,
`malformed-list`, `malformed-row`, `malformed-toml`, `duplicate-key`,
`ambiguous-leading-label` — makes the whole source Unknown (no items, no
denominators), and a duplicate key within one source is such a failure
while cross-source duplicates are left for 2.6's contradiction handling;
(e) a source whose classes all succeed carries per-class item counts as its
denominators, which 2.6/2.7 sum into the per-class D. The REQ-002 oracle is
a regex-only second extractor inside the test file; 35 rule-6 mutations
killed with digest-verified restore
(`docs/evidence/pwb-p2-5-extraction-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json`). Still no
Butlers read: extraction is called by nothing before P4.

P2.6 note, recorded 2026-09-04: `project-shape-coverage.ts` is coverage as
data over the classified-and-extracted population. Decisions: (a) the
source population is the input list unchanged and in order; each source
carries a known item denominator or an Unknown one with the classifier's
fixed reason, and a grammar failure becomes the policy's `parse-failure`
exclusion (hash kept, failure named, `excluded-content`); (b) facts are
reconciled from declarations — `item:<class>:<key>` for identities (a
second declaration of one identity is a conflict whatever its statement
says, per the spec's duplicate-key rule), `count:<class>` derived from the
admitted items, and stated declarations supplied from outside the grammar
(fixtures now; empty in production until Butlers is observed to declare a
summary that the model may read); (c) a conflict is resolved only by a
`PrecedenceRule` whose anchor path is in the admitted population and whose
two selectors each match exactly one declaration; rules with disagreeing
winners, out-of-scope facts or unmatched sides decide nothing and the fact
is Unknown with RFC2-24's `contradicted-pending-adjudication`, every
declaration retained and every considered rule's outcome recorded; (d) a
count over a class with any Unknown-denominator source is itself Unknown
with that source's reason, whatever a summary states; (e) item states are
modeled or contradicted, `unknown` is reachable only through count facts,
and per class modeled + unknown + contradicted equals the declared count
while D is known only when every source of the class was readable.
`[Unknown]` still whether Butlers declares any precedence rule — the first
live run (P4's second half) answers it; the eight-versus-nine domain-butler
conflict is the first fixture either way. 27 rule-6 mutations killed
(`docs/evidence/pwb-p2-6-coverage-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json`). Still no
Butlers read.

P2.7 note, recorded 2026-09-04: `project-shape-model.ts` composes P1–P2.6
into the one `ProjectShape` value that `model.ts` places on `PocModel`;
`GET /api/poc` is still `JSON.stringify(model)`, so the machine answer is
extended by construction. Decisions: (a) the gate runs first — a
non-admitting evaluation issues zero Git commands and the shape is
`not-admitted` with the gate's reasons; no evaluation at all is
`not-evaluated` with the loader's failure text, Unknown as
`unconsented-source-or-provider`; (b) every claim is a full PWB-REQ-007
tuple — stable claim id, the PWB-REQ-005 evaluation id, cap1-core's
`EpistemicState` (label, tier, one primary and deduplicated secondary
reasons, freshness), a resolution route per reason from a twelve-entry
table keyed by RFC2-24's vocabulary, challenge `unchallenged` (no challenge
channel exists yet), and support anchors (path, line, content digest,
source identity); (c) Observed claims are `report-fact` ("the source
declares X") and `fresh` (bound to the evaluated revision); contradictions
are `suspended`; an excluded, uncaptured or absent source is Unknown with
the classifier's reason; (d) the whole-shape claim derives from its members
(sources and reconciled facts): the first Unknown member's reason is
primary, the rest secondary, and observer degradation is disclosed beside
it as data because the population never shrinks; (e) class aggregates
carry label, tier, freshness and primary/secondary reason counts over
members and declaring sources, never a headline; (f) phase B re-lists the
tree at the resolved commit rather than reusing phase A's listing, so the
reader is bound to the same object ids the manifest recorded; (g) the
daemon evaluates the authority from its own working directory's governance
tree at every model build and fails closed to `not-evaluated` if the
inputs cannot be loaded; (h) `walkthroughJudgment` is deferred to 4.6 and
no live Butlers observation was run — the model is exercised only through
an in-memory Git runner over a Butlers-shaped fixture. Item-level
contradiction and item-level `unknown` are unreachable through the P2.5
grammar (each identity has one declaring source; a duplicate key inside a
source is a grammar failure), so those branches are tested at the exported
`itemClaim` seam. 38 rule-6 mutations killed
(`docs/evidence/pwb-p2-7-model-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json`). Still no
Butlers read.

P3.1 note, recorded 2026-09-04: `apps/three-surface-poc/src/polaris.ts`
now opens with the seven project-level groups in the task's order —
Overview, Boundaries, Architecture, V1, Project catalog, Capability detail,
Evidence and gaps — rendered exactly once each from `PocModel.projectShape`
(PWB-REQ-010; RFC7-1, RFC7-13). Decisions: (a) the movement scaffolding and
the "three movements" tally are gone; the WhatsApp slice renders unchanged
under "Capability detail" behind a scope instruction naming it one
capability within the complete catalog; (b) group membership is fixed:
Overview = purpose and promises plus the project-account class aggregate;
Boundaries = refusals plus principles; Architecture = the architecture
statement plus topology components; V1 = V1 scope, V1 success and success
criteria; Project catalog = declared projects, roster identities, design
contracts, baseline specs and craft policies, each class as its own block
with declared/modeled/Unknown/contradicted counts and a denominator that
is Unknown when a source was unreadable; (c) an unobserved shape
(`not-evaluated`, `not-admitted`, `observation-failed`) renders every
project group as Unknown in place with the shape claim's reason, its route
and the kind-specific detail — never an empty group (RFC7-15); (d) every
rendered project-shape claim carries a `claim-tuple` span with claim id,
label, tier, freshness and evaluation id, and Observed leaves cite
path:line plus the exact content digest, linked to a source row in
"Evidence and gaps" that carries the source digest, rule, outcome and
denominator (PWB-REQ-011; RFC7-16); reconciled facts that agree are not
rendered as separate claims (their counts are the class blocks),
contradicted facts are, with every declaration kept; (e) exclusions render
as hash-not-body (path, redaction class, detector or reason, digest,
policy) and an Unknown-by-reason list closes the group with
`missing-declaration` and `unconsented-source-or-provider` foremost; (f)
the copy for the new groups already meets PWB-REQ-012's bounds (headings
≤ 6 words, ledes ≤ 20, no prohibited vocabulary), tested for the group
headings, ledes, notice and shell lede only — the exhaustive `polaris-copy.ts`
role table and independent extractor remain task 3.3; (g) surface tests
reach an `observed` shape through `test-project-shape-fixture.ts`, an
in-memory Butlers-shaped Git runner plus admitting/rejecting authority
evaluations (a copy of the core fixture texts, kept in the app so the
core's test module stays private). Five hand rule-6 mutations: four killed
(group reorder, excluded-body leak, empty unobserved groups, omitted
route); the fifth (hard-coding freshness to `fresh`) is equivalent because
the model stamps every claim `fresh` — a freshness-varying claim does not
exist yet, so no test can distinguish it. Still no Butlers read.

P3.2 note, recorded 2026-09-04: the slice's move below the catalog was
made by 3.1; 3.2 adds the proof that the move changed position only. The
test renders both an unevaluated and an observed shape and checks, per
entity, that its section sits inside "Capability detail", carries exactly
the model's provenance sources and revisions in order, and exactly the
model's label and reason; per relationship, the one marker the model's
label implies; and that the slice's bytes are identical across the two
shapes. Three hand mutations (an added citation, an Unknown entity
relabeled Observed, slice copy varying with the shape) are killed.

**P3.3 note (task 3.3, syzygy-1z3.11, 2026-09-04).** Every fixed Polaris
string now lives in one table, `apps/three-surface-poc/src/polaris-copy.ts`,
each row carrying exactly one PWB-REQ-012 role (`project-fact`,
`epistemic-disclosure`, `action-label`, `scope-instruction`) and a kind
(heading, lede, notice, sentence, label). The renderer takes text only from
that table or from the shared model and marks the element carrying it with
`data-copy-role`; the shared shell (`page-shell.ts`, `design-tokens.ts`)
marks the nav, skip link, eyebrow, title, lede, legend and footer the same
way, so the role is machine-readable in the served HTML. Decisions: (a) the
seven group ledes from 3.1 were removed — each group header is one heading
and nothing else, since a lede saying what the group is about was connective
prose about the surface; (b) the relationships lede is the table sentence
"Each claim above stands alone; the links below say how far the evidence
reaches between them." (project-fact); (c) the capability scope instruction
is the one POC-bound entry (`data-scope="poc-bound"`) and the shell lede is
a second scope-instruction without the bound, so "at most one entry stating
the POC bound" is checked as a count of that attribute; (d) a string's role
is its innermost declaring ancestor, so a tuple inside a project-fact row
keeps `epistemic-disclosure` because the tuple span declares it itself — the
oracle additionally requires every `claim-tuple`/`unknown-disclosure`
element to declare that role directly; (e) templated sentences (counts,
reasons, paths) are not table rows, so the oracle sweeps rendered text, not
the table. The oracle (`polaris-copy.test.ts`) is a plain stack extractor
over the served HTML with its own word counter, role set, word limits
(headings ≤6, ledes ≤20) and prohibited regex, run over five fixtures
reaching all four shape arms (`not-evaluated`, `not-admitted`,
`observation-failed`, `observed` with and without an excluded body). Its
falsifiers are exercised by a meta-narration counterexample that must
trigger every rule (unclassified, unknown role, multiply classified,
heading/lede over limit, prohibited term, second POC-bound entry, POC-bound
with the wrong role, two action labels on one control, tuple without the
disclosure role). The table check restates by hand the six rows the fixtures
cannot reach (deferred, limit-breaches, no-route, missing-statement,
declarations-kept, no-body-read) and fails if one becomes reachable. Eight
hand mutations of the renderer and shell (dropping a role from the tuple,
the Unknown disclosure, a statement and the nav; a prohibited word in a
heading; a second POC-bound entry; a group lede; a role outside the set)
are all killed. The 3.1 copy-bounds test is superseded and removed.

**P3.4 note (task 3.4, syzygy-1z3.12, 2026-09-04).** The one OpenSpec change
the POC follows is now a distinct machine type on the shared model,
`PocModel.proposedWork` (`packages/three-surface-poc-core/src/proposed-work.ts`),
never an entity, a project-account statement or a catalog item. It carries
the change id and amended spec directory parsed from the delta path, the
proposal and delta artifacts (path, revision, digest), a lifecycle state read
from the exact tree listing already on the model (`active` when
`openspec/changes/<id>/` is present and no archived copy is, `archived` when
only an archive copy is, Unknown when both, neither, or no tree), and the
current authority it would amend: the project shape's own `baseline-spec`
item for that directory (identity and tuple preserved, PWB-REQ-011) or
Unknown with the shape's reason and route (`unconsented-source-or-provider`
when the shape was not evaluated, `missing-declaration` when the observed
shape has no such spec). Polaris renders it exactly once, inside the
capability-detail group after the entity sections, as a labeled section
("Proposed change — not current authority.") whose current-authority part
comes first and whose proposal part follows, adjacent. The capability's
relationships list moved from the evidence group into capability detail, so
no proposed identity is rendered outside that group; the 3.2 byte-identity
guarantee now covers the entity sections, the proposal part and the
relationships separately, with only the current-authority part allowed to
follow the shape. The oracle (`polaris-proposed-work.test.ts`) restates the
proposed identities by hand from the fixture repository's OpenSpec artifacts
and checks, over unevaluated, observed-without-baseline and
observed-with-baseline shapes, that none appears in the project-level or
evidence slices, that the section appears once with lifecycle and label,
that the current authority shares the catalog item's claim id and rendered
tuple, and that the machine answer carries the same identities. Eleven hand
mutations (proposal rendered in the overview, before the entities or in the
evidence group; label dropped; parts swapped; Unknown authority rendered as
Observed; archived read as active; contradiction ignored; prefix matching a
longer change id; any baseline spec accepted; wrong Unknown reason) are all
killed. No Butlers body is read: lifecycle uses tree paths and the
artifacts were already hashed by the proving slice.

**P3.5 note (task 3.5, syzygy-1z3.13, 2026-09-04).** Every Polaris claim
tuple now renders the complete PWB-REQ-007 set — label, tier, one primary
reason, closed secondary reasons, freshness, challenge state and evaluation
id — as data attributes plus visible text (`Label (primary; secondary) ·
tier · freshness · challenge`). Every Unknown reason is rendered beside its
route. Aggregates (the nine classes and the whole shape) disclose their own
tuple, then primary and secondary member Unknown-reason counts in two
separate lists, each row routed; the class statement names the declaring
sources instead of a count wall, and coverage counts (declared, modeled,
Unknown, contradicted, unreadable sources) sit only inside a `<details>`
element opened on demand. No headline status, maturity, success rate,
percentage or trend appears anywhere on the page.
`polaris-epistemic-tuples.test.ts` is the oracle with hand-typed
vocabularies (three labels, six tiers plus `unstated`, twelve reasons, four
freshness states plus `unstated`, `unchallenged`): every tuple is in
vocabulary and equal to the machine claim, every reason has a route, every
reason-count list equals the machine's separate primary/secondary maps, the
three coverage states reconcile to the known denominator, and a status
vocabulary regex matches nothing in the page text. Item-level Unknown and
secondary reasons are unreachable through the fixtures, so
`denominatorText` and `reasonCountsBlock` are exported and tested at the
seam. Rule-6 evidence:
`docs/evidence/pwb-p3-5-tuple-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json` (10/10 killed,
digest-verified restore).

**P3.6 note (task 3.6, syzygy-1z3.14, 2026-09-04).** Every owner-visible
narrative unit on Polaris (every element carrying a copy role, shell chrome
included) now carries exactly one claim role — `anchored-project-fact`,
`non-normative-framing` or `epistemic-claim` — plus `data-presentation-artifact`
and `data-non-citable`. Anchored blocks are registered during the render by
`apps/three-surface-poc/src/polaris-narrative.ts` (`NarrativeRegistry`): a
block names its claims and a deduplicated anchor set, each anchor typed by the
closed class set (doctrine, contract, requirement, decision, evidence, work),
bound to a revision, carrying a durable target identity (the registry's
git-tree-entry identity, a content digest, a tree or Dolt revision — never a
bare path, label or coordinate), the claims it supports, and the target's
captured label/tier/reason, cloned and deep-frozen at registration. Anchor
rules: entity/relationship provenance → class by provenance kind; shape claims
→ their support anchors as evidence (the baseline spec beside the proposal is
cited as requirement); the whole shape → the one evaluated tree; code
structure → the tree; work items → the Dolt revision; the proposal → its
proposal (work) and delta (requirement) digests. The machine form is an
`application/json` script placed before the first group (`polaris-narrative`),
distinct from the kernel claim tuple and from `/api/poc`, which is unchanged by
construction. Personal view state (`PolarisViewState.openCoverageCounts`) is a
render parameter that only toggles `<details open>`.
`polaris-narrative.test.ts` is the oracle (hand-typed roles and classes, an
independent claim-to-anchor re-derivation from the model JSON checking exact
covering and no surplus, ≤6 anchors per block, rendered cite per anchor,
captured-state equality, frozen registration, view state outside truth).
`polaris-authority-sweep.test.ts` is the downstream sweep over three
populations with denominators: every machine reference on the model and its
anchors; every OpenSpec warrant entry (all in hand-typed id families;
`POLARIS-DIR-*` entries are owner decisions); and every source/authority/
provenance-shaped line in the governance, spec, code and docs trees — zero
Polaris-surface targets. `[Unknown]` The Butlers-side reference population:
no Butlers body read is lawful for that purpose, so the Butlers half of the
sweep stays Unknown until a live run under the consented class provides it.
Rule-6 evidence: `docs/evidence/pwb-p3-6-narrative-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json`
(17/17 killed, digest-verified restore).

P3.7 implemented 2026-09-04 (task 3.7, PWB-REQ-015, `syzygy-1z3.15`).
`capability-detail.ts` owns the data side of the deep dive: the closed band
vocabulary (`argument` / `contract` / `reality`) with one authority class each
(`authored-non-normative` / `referenced-verbatim` / `kernel-computed`),
`deriveCapabilityDeepDives(model)` (one dive per capability entity; adoption
read from the observed tree — `adopted` when the shape holds the baseline
spec, `draft` when it does not, Unknown otherwise; proposals from
`proposedWork`; exclusivity `not-captured` because the model captures no
OpenSpec exclusivity declaration, so every proposal is its own future),
`resolveVerbatim` and the `DeepDiveLedger`. `polaris.ts` composes the HTML:
every `<section>` inside the dive carries exactly one `data-band` plus its
class and is recorded in the ledger; the machine form (`deepDives` on the
PWB-REQ-014 narrative script) lists the band population, the intent leaf and
verbatim state, and each proposal as `anchorable:false, statusBearing:false`.
Base is the only mode (`data-reading-mode="Base"`, reality band always
rendered); the proposed-scenario mode (RFC7-26) is outside this change.
Verbatim requirement text: the plan said "loaded from the owning artifact at
render, never stored". The leaf is the baseline spec at the shape's revision,
which lies outside the consented `declared-project-shape-text` class, so
production passes no reader and the contract band discloses
`unconsented-source-or-provider` beside the leaf's captured identity
(`PolarisRenderInputs.verbatim` is the render-time seam; bytes are rendered
only when they hash to the captured git object id / sha256, are NUL-free
UTF-8, and appear once on the page, never in the machine form or the model).
`[Unknown]` The live rendering of real Butlers requirement text stays Unknown
until an act extends consent to that class. Doctrine and non-goal parts are
Unknown `missing-declaration` (the consented grammar declares no capability →
doctrine/non-goal link) or the shape's own reason when the shape is not
observed. Proposals moved from an anchored block to a non-anchored,
non-status-bearing block (RFC1-22): no `data-anchor-*`, no narrative block, no
tuple; artifacts cited by digest as `data-proposal-artifact`; each proposal is
a `data-candidate-future` with `data-exclusive-with` from declared groups.
`polaris-capability-detail.test.ts` is the oracle (hand-typed bands and
classes, a stack walk over every `<section>` for one-band-per-block and
enclosure, machine-form population equality, byte-equality of rendered text to
the fixture repository's own baseline bytes, fail-closed forged/unreadable/
binary readers, draft vs adopted from the model's own lookup, proposal
non-anchorability against the whole anchor population, the two-incompatible-
proposals sweep case through the exported `renderCapabilityDeepDive` seam,
and a static-source sweep over every non-test `.ts` under `apps/` and
`packages/` for requirement/scenario/doctrine/non-goal grammar in string
literals — zero offenders). Rule-6 evidence:
`docs/evidence/pwb-p3-7-bands-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json` (18/18 killed,
digest-verified restore).

P3.8 implemented 2026-09-04 (task 3.8, PWB-REQ-011/016/020, `syzygy-1z3.16`).
Polaris now opens with a depth list (`<nav class="depth-nav">`, labelled by
its own visible line) of native links in document order: summary (the four
account groups), catalog (the catalog group and each of its five class
sections), detail (the capability group and each deep dive, which now carries
`id="polaris-deep-dive-<capability>"`), exact source (evidence group, sources,
exclusions, contradictions, gaps — a level lists only what that shape state
renders). Every gaps-list entry carries `id="polaris-gap-<reason>"`, and every
other mention of an enumerated reason (`unknownRoutes`, `reasonCountsBlock`,
the deep dive's Unknown lines) links to it; a reason the page does not
enumerate stays text, never a link to nothing. Contradiction entries carry
`id="polaris-fact-<claim>"` and each kept declaration's anchor links to its
source row when the page carries that source. Wide tables render inside a
`role="region" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby=<heading id>` container so a
keyboard-only reader can scroll them. The page's link targets are module
state (`activeTargets`) computed once per render from the shape population
and cleared with the registry. `ProjectShapeModelInput` now forwards optional
`rules`/`statedDeclarations` to the coverage step (the daemon passes none);
the test injects one stated summary that disagrees with the derived principle
count to reach the contradiction path. `polaris-reachability.test.ts` is the
oracle with its own tag scanner and CSS sweep: no dangling internal link and
no duplicate id in four shape states; the four depths in document order over
the exact target population; the PWB-REQ-011 category sweep from depth list to
class section to item row to the source row whose identity and claim id equal
the machine answer (path count equals the model's Observed leaf count); gaps
and contradiction multisets equal the oracle's own count from the serialized
model, with every reason mention linked and every declaration anchor linked;
no `on*` handler, no button, tabindex only `0`, every scroll region named by
a rendered heading, `:focus-visible` outline present, and no `outline: none`,
`display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, absolute/fixed positioning, float,
`order`, or reversed flex outside the skip link; every element of each
colour-bearing class (`unknown-disclosure`, `proposal`, `band`, `claim-tuple`)
names its state in text. `[Unknown]` stayed as §9 recorded until P4.4 (below)
added the browser-driven focus-order and accessibility-tree traces; the
keyboard-only cold-open walkthrough remains manual evidence (PWB-REQ-016's
record). Rule-6
evidence: `docs/evidence/pwb-p3-8-reachability-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json`
(19/19 killed, digest-verified restore).

P4.1 implemented 2026-09-04 (task 4.1, PWB-REQ-022 plus the per-requirement
behavior-test sweep, `syzygy-1z3.17`). `walkthrough-judgment.ts` is the
PWB-REQ-022 evaluator over the pair (execution record under
`.syzygy/governance/records/`, owner judgment under
`.syzygy/governance/decisions/`): outcome `absent` (2 cases: no run record,
no judgment — a judgment without an owner act counts as no judgment),
`unlawful` (the closed 84-case population: 2 governance-home, 15 run-record
field, 12 judgment field, 55 common act cases restated from PWB-REQ-005 in
the same predicate order, recording exactly `verdict-unlawful`, Unknown
never met, no verdict, an RFC3-16(a) contradiction) or `lawful` (the owner's
verdict carried as `recorded-human-judgment` with exact state label, the
state-(1) sentence from `authority-disclosure.ts`, and
`independentlyVerified` true only for state (2)). Design readings recorded
here: the judgment's exact run-record reference is `<identity>@<sha256>`,
which transitively binds the surface version and evaluation identity the
record names; the verdict field is `<criterion>=met|not-met`, so "wrong
but present" is a verdict on another criterion; a rationale is "wrong" when
it reasons about a different walkthrough-record identity; traversed paths
are "wrong" when one lies outside the controlled route population. The 55
common predicates are deliberately duplicated rather than shared with
`body-read-authority.ts`, so the body-read risk floor and its act-bound
mutation evidence stay byte-identical. State (2) stays unreachable in
production (`JUDGMENT_CORRELATION_UNAVAILABLE`); history is append-only
(`appendJudgmentEvaluation`). The test hand-types all 84 + 2 cases and the
two state labels/disclosure, never importing the vocabulary, and reads the
evaluator source as text to prove one predicate per case. Behavior-test
sweep: every PWB-REQ id in the spec (17) now names at least one test file;
PWB-REQ-021's comprehension oracle is the owner's, so its code-side test is
the PWB-REQ-022 pair evaluator and its evidence is the P8 record. Not wired
into the model or Polaris yet (4.6/4.3 own that). Rule-6 evidence:
`docs/evidence/pwb-p4-1-judgment-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json`.

P4.2 implemented 2026-09-04 (task 4.2, the consolidated rule-6 mutation
sweep, `syzygy-1z3.18`). `apps/three-surface-poc/src/pwb-mutation-sweep.ts`
is one re-runnable plan over the nine mutation classes the task names, each
a group with its own subject files, independent test files and mutations:
source denominator (PWB-REQ-001: a named-but-absent file, an unreadable
pillar index and a non-blob source dropped from the manifest/observer
population), coverage partition (PWB-REQ-002: the contradicted partition
zeroed, a class denominator numbered over an Unknown source, a count fact
modeled over an Unknown denominator), precedence guard (PWB-REQ-004: the
anchor-population check removed, "last declaration wins" without a rule,
disagreeing rules letting the first decide), secret sentinel (PWB-REQ-003:
no detector matching, `lastIndex` not reset), capability-first regression
(PWB-REQ-010: the one-capability scope marker dropped, the retired framing
marker restored, capability detail rendered above the catalog), meta-copy
prohibition (PWB-REQ-012: a heading naming the page, the epistemic notice
misroled), every admission invalid case with exact state, exact
disclosure, no fallback and append-only history (PWB-REQ-005: task 2.5's
86 predicate sites and 11 literals reused verbatim), every judgment invalid
case with the same four properties (PWB-REQ-022: 84 case predicates, the
history guard and 13 literals) and parity markers (PWB-REQ-020: markers
renamed or dropped on Polaris, Trajectory, Orrery and the home tables).
`pwb-mutation-sweep-main.ts` (`npm run poc:pwb-mutation-sweep`, `--group`
/ `--only` to narrow) runs each group's baseline green, applies one
mutation at a time, runs only that group's tests, restores and
digest-verifies the subject, and records the failing test names beside the
must-fail names; `pwb-mutation-sweep.test.ts` keeps the plan applicable
(every fragment occurs exactly once, every class has one group, the
predicate subjects still expose 86 and 85 sites). The first full run found
four survivors: two were wrong must-fail names (the coverage suite killed
the mutation through another test), two were real oracle gaps, repaired
in the tests rather than waived — the copy oracle's disclosure-role rule
did not cover the page notice, and no test compared the anchor digest
shown beside a citation with the source's exact digest in the machine
answer. Evidence: `docs/evidence/pwb-p4-2-mutation-sweep-2026-09-04.json`
(per-class denominators, per-mutation failing tests, digests before and
after).

P4.3 implemented 2026-09-04 (task 4.3, exhaustive Polaris parity with the
authority and judgment states, `syzygy-1z3.19`). The one `PocModel` now
carries `walkthroughJudgment`: either `not-evaluated` with a stated detail
(what the daemon serves until 4.6 records a run/judgment pair) or the
PWB-REQ-022 evaluation of an injected pair, computed inside
`buildButlersPocModel` so `/api/poc` grows by construction. Polaris renders
the body-read authority line (one `authority-state` marker per authority,
the mode, the evaluation id) beside every shape state that carries one, and
a walkthrough-judgment section whose every field — kind, verdict, judging
party, evidence kind, state label, independent-verification flag, the
state disclosure sentence, act identity and instant, both digests, run
record identity/mode/surface version/evaluation identity, every traversed
path with repeats kept, rationale, or the absent/unlawful case and
contradiction — is a leaf parity marker. The new
`polaris-parity-sweep.test.ts` is the independent oracle PWB-REQ-020 asks
for: it parses the rendered page back with its own extractor (no
production vocabulary or rendering import), projects the machine answer
itself, and compares every marker family as a multiset, reporting both
denominators, across a 5 × 6 matrix (not-evaluated, not-admitted,
observation-failed, observed and a degraded observed variant in which one
phase-B body read fails, so Unknown sources, reason counts and gaps are
exercised; times six judgment states including a fixture-only state (2)).
Two honest scoping rules are written into the oracle: the presented claim
population omits the reconciled facts (their content reaches the reader
through item rows and class aggregates; only contradictions are presented
as facts) and the project-account-section items (presented once as the
account's own section claims), and the two capability-slice region cites
(`git-ls-tree`, `beads-dolt`) are admitted only while the machine's
region is observed. The mutation sweep's parity-markers group gains four
classes × five kinds (fact, authority-state, judgment-state, disclosure ×
missing, duplicated, changed, collapsed, wrong-evaluation) as exact-fragment
mutations of `polaris.ts`, each named to the matrix cell that must fail.
The first run left two survivors: an equivalent authority-state mutation
(rewritten so it always changes the text) and a collapsed Unknown
relationship disclosure that the one-directional disclosure check could
not see — repaired in the oracle, which now also compares the machine's
Unknown relationships and entities against the rendered disclosures as
multisets. Evidence (26/26 killed):
`docs/evidence/pwb-p4-2-mutation-sweep-2026-09-04-parity-markers.json`.

P4.4 implemented 2026-09-04 (task 4.4, keyboard/non-visual navigation and
WCAG AA contrast measured in a real browser, `syzygy-1z3.20`). The §9
"needs a browser driver" gap is closed without a new dependency:
`apps/three-surface-poc/src/cdp-browser.ts` launches a locally installed
Chrome/Chromium headless (`SYZYGY_POC_BROWSER`, else the first of
`google-chrome`/`google-chrome-stable`/`chromium`/`chromium-browser` on
PATH; nothing is downloaded) and speaks the DevTools protocol over Node's
own WebSocket. `polaris-accessibility.ts` is the PWB-REQ-016 oracle outside
the renderer: it enumerates the focusable population from the live DOM
(links, disclosure summaries and `tabindex="0"` regions only — any other
focusable or any `button` role in the accessibility tree is a violation),
presses real Tab keys until the sequence wraps and requires the trace to
equal the population in document order with no trap, mirrors it with
Shift+Tab, requires a visible focus outline with a 3:1 indicator on every
stop, activates every fragment link with a real Enter press (target must
exist, become `:target`, and the next Tab must land on the first focusable
after it — or lawfully wrap when none follows), reads the browser's own
accessibility tree (every link, heading, region and navigation named; link
count equal to the DOM's), and measures WCAG AA contrast for every rendered
text element plus every targeted row against the composited backdrop
(ancestor background colours with alpha, forking at gradients and judging
against the worst candidate; 4.5:1, or 3:1 for large text). Every check
reports its denominator. `polaris-accessibility-variants.ts` renders six
Polaris pages from the in-memory fixtures (observed; observed with a lawful
state-(1) judgment; degraded with an unlawful judgment; not-admitted;
observation-failed; not-evaluated) and names every rendered group and deep
dive as a required target; `polaris-accessibility.browser.test.ts` is
`describe.skipIf`-gated on a browser (skipped is never reported as
passed) and `npm run poc:accessibility-check` writes the evidence
(`docs/evidence/pwb-p4-4-accessibility-browser-run-2026-09-04.json`:
browser identity, commit, per-variant traces, activations, tree counts,
contrast minima). The first measured run found one genuine defect: the
coverage-counts `<summary>` disclosure was focusable but outside the
`:focus-visible` rule, so its default outline measured 1.01:1 on the dark
ground; `design-tokens.ts` now styles `summary:focus-visible` with the same
3px focus outline. The daemon never imports the driver or the checker;
no Butlers repository is read. Rule-6 evidence:
`docs/evidence/pwb-p4-4-accessibility-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json`
(ten mutations of `design-tokens.ts`/`polaris.ts` — the summary fix
reverted, `outline: none`, low-contrast focus/muted/lede colours, a
renamed skip-link target, an unfocusable scroll region, a broken source
link target, a link given `role="button"`, a dropped depth-nav group
link — each run against the browser check with digest-verified restore).
Hosted CI's runner ships Chrome, so the gated suite runs there; the
keyboard-only cold-open walkthrough record (PWB-REQ-022) remains the
owner's manual evidence and is untouched by this automation.

P4.5 implemented 2026-09-04 (task 4.5, the fresh-checkout demonstration,
`syzygy-1z3.21`). `apps/three-surface-poc/src/fresh-checkout-demo-main.ts`
(`npm run poc:fresh-checkout-demo -- --repo <butlers>`) is a separate,
manually invoked binary — the daemon never imports it — that clones this
repository's `HEAD` into a temporary directory (tags included, so the P1
gate can see the `pwb-*-signed-*` recording tags), runs `npm ci`, `npm run
build` and the whole Vitest suite with a JUnit reporter, starts the
clone's own built daemon against the one configured Butlers repository
with a throwaway state directory, and fetches `/`, `/polaris`,
`/trajectory`, `/orrery` and `/api/poc` (once without a credential, once
with the minted bearer token). It then compares the Polaris claim tuples
with the machine answer's presented claim population under the 4.3
oracle's rule (reconciled facts and project-account-section items are
folded into their account statements; contradictions render as their own
claims). The committed evidence
(`docs/evidence/pwb-p4-5-fresh-checkout-demo-2026-09-04.json`) carries
commits, timings, exit codes, test totals read from the JUnit root tag
only, route statuses and byte sizes, the parity counts, and a body-free
summary of the project shape (authority verdict without act digests,
counts, class denominators, source paths with label and reason,
exclusions counted by reason). The full route bodies and the JUnit file
are retained only on the recording machine under
`~/.local/state/syzygy/pwb-p4-5-fresh-checkout-demo-2026-09-04/`
because they carry the act arguments (CG-7e) and Butlers text (the
consent excludes egress; this repository is pushed to GitHub). The
Butlers pytest capture was deliberately not run: the demo's test
artifact is the clone's own suite, and `testArtifactVerification` stays
Unknown.

Live findings from the measured run, `[Observed]` against Butlers `HEAD`
at the recorded revision from a clone of `7de2f68`: install, build and
the suite (1212 tests, no failures) exit 0; the daemon exits 0 with an
empty stderr; all five routes answer 200 and the machine route answers
401 without a credential. The P1 gate admits in `owner-trusted-bootstrap`
mode with all three authorities in state (1) — the shape is `observed`.
Of 256 sources, 122 are Observed and 134 Unknown, every Unknown with
reason `excluded-content`: 132 sources are excluded as `active-content`
under the act-bound policy and one by the `known-token-formats` detector.
The excluded set includes the lay-and-land pillar index, so that pillar's
named files are Unknown and the observation is degraded as a partial
snapshot; the heart-and-soul pillar's index is also unknown. Design
contracts (29) and craft policies (7) have fully known denominators;
baseline specs have 76 modelled items over an Unknown denominator (107
excluded sources), roster identities 5 over 7 excluded, and the one
topology-component source is excluded. All six project-account statements
are Unknown with `missing-declaration`, so the whole-shape claim is
Unknown. 126 facts reconcile with no contradiction and no precedence rule
was needed. Parity: 389 Polaris claim tuples over 389 presented machine
claim ids, no human-only and no machine-only id; the 126 reconciled facts
are the whole omitted-by-design count. These answer §9's grammar
question as recorded findings for the 5.x review/repair cycle, not as
defects fixed here: the active-content rule is the act-bound policy's and
changes only by a new act; whether the pillar-index grammar mismatch is a
grammar question or an expected exclusion is for the review to say.

P4.6 prepared 2026-09-04 (task 4.6, the owner cold-open walkthrough,
`syzygy-1z3.22`; the walkthrough and judgment themselves are the owner's and
remain pending). The agent-side deliverables: `apps/three-surface-poc/src/
walkthrough-inputs.ts` is the daemon's loader for the PWB-REQ-022 pair,
mirroring `governance-inputs.ts` (same artifact, act-record, recording-tag
and lifecycle classification — those helpers are now exported from the
body-read loader rather than duplicated). Its controlled expectations are
the `PWB_WALKTHROUGH_SCHEDULE` table: serial identities
(`PWB-WALKTHROUGH-001`, act `PWB-COLD-OPEN-WALKTHROUGH-JUDGMENT-001`, tag
`pwb-adopt-walkthrough-judgment-signed-001`, phrase prefix `ADOPT POLARIS
COLD-OPEN WALKTHROUGH JUDGMENT`), the criterion
`polaris-cold-open-comprehension`, keyboard-only mode, the five human
routes as the surface population, both governance homes, and an
`evaluationIdentity` the recording session fixes when it writes the run
record (the daemon's own evaluation id carries colons and is not a
run-record identity, so the record names a slug for the run the owner
read). `main.ts` now evaluates the pair on every model build; an absent
record evaluates as `absent` (Unknown, never met) and only a loader throw
leaves `not-evaluated` with the failure named. The real-tree test pins the
current state — no run record exists — and refuses to pass by accident
once one does. Rule-6 evidence:
`docs/evidence/pwb-p4-6-walkthrough-inputs-mutation-run-2026-09-04.json`
(7/7 killed: run record read from the wrong home, act text ignored, tag
assumed resolved, A1 expected present, lifecycle ignored, judgment home
moved, mode changed). The state and invalid-arm sweep the task names is
`walkthrough-judgment.test.ts` (84 + 2 cases, both valid states, state-(2)
no-fallback, verified this session) and the 4.3 parity matrix's five
judgment states. The owner packet is
`.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/pwb-walkthrough/OWNER-WALKTHROUGH-PACKET.md`:
the nine prompts (RFC7-30's six plus PWB-REQ-021's two additions and the
strength prompt), the keyboard-only rule, what to send back, and the five
recording steps. Recording-session steps still to do once the owner
replies: write the run record and set the evaluation slug; draft the
judgment from the owner's words; register the act phrase and its packet
copies in `check_governance.py` (`_act_subjects`, `ACT_DIGEST_COPY_FILES`)
before the finalized packet quotes a digest; record the act, tag and
aggregate row after the owner performs it; re-pin the real-tree test.

Nothing lands in `openspec/**` or `.syzygy/**`. The walkthrough execution
record (PWB-REQ-022) is a governance record written by the recording
session, not by the daemon; the owner judgment is an owner act prepared as a
packet, the same way task 1.7 was.

## 3. The body-read gate

This is the risk-floor of the change. Design so the spec's falsifier "any
body is read before all three acts are effective" is structurally hard to
violate:

1. **Inputs are files, not flags.** `governance-inputs.ts` resolves the
   observing checkout root (the same root `pocObserverInputsAreClean`
   already inspects), then reads exactly: the three act-bound artifacts
   (consent record, policy JSON, registry entry) and their three dedicated
   act records under `decisions/`. Each read yields `{kind:'present', bytes,
   sha256}` or a typed failure (`missing`, `unreadable`, `malformed`). A
   `repoRoot` option plus injectable `readFile` / `listDirectory` / `runGit`
   serve hermetic tests (replacing the planned `--governance-dir` flag).
2. **The act record is parsed, never trusted.** `owner-act-record.ts`
   extracts the labelled fields the 2026-09-02 records carry: act identity,
   act type, project identity, artifact identity, exact digest, provenance
   state, supersession/revocation, A1 identity or explicit absence, owner,
   date, ceremony phrase, recording tag. Each field is `present | missing |
   malformed`; the parser owns no notion of validity.
3. **Evaluation is a pure function.** `evaluateBodyReadAuthority(inputs) →
   { admits: boolean; consent: AuthorityState; policy: AuthorityState;
   registry: AuthorityState; contradiction?: … }` where `AuthorityState` is
   `valid(state-1 | state-2) | invalid(caseId) | absent(artifact-missing |
   artifact-unreadable | act-record-absent)`; `absent` is a non-admitting
   outcome outside the 195 present-invalid cases. Per authority it checks,
   in order: false substitutes first (a record that is only a tag, commit,
   sign-off, machine submission or agent assertion has no fields to judge),
   then the nine RFC3-16(b) items (item 3 by recomputing the
   artifact's SHA-256 from the bytes just read and comparing to the act
   argument, so an edited artifact is "wrong but present digest"); the
   association (act record names this artifact); the provenance-state input;
   lifecycle (stale, expired, superseded,
   revoked); state mechanics (state (1) explicitly selected; A1 explicitly
   absent for state (1); claimed state (2) needs successful correlation);
   state-(1) record semantics (phrase and recording tag present, well-formed
   and matching); then the authority-specific fields (consent subject pair
   and content class; policy-owning project and version; registry home,
   project, repository, read-only authority and empty write surface). The
   first failing predicate names the case; every predicate is independently
   reachable. `[Observed]` 2026-09-03: 85 predicate sites — 55 common ones
   shared by the three authorities (× 3 = 165 instances) plus 30
   authority-specific — carry the 195 case instances; there is no bucket.
4. **State (2) is unavailable in this repository.** `[Observed]` No RFC5-25
   audit trail exists. Correlation is an injected function whose production
   value returns `unavailable`; any record claiming state (2) is therefore
   invalid today and never falls back to state (1). Tests inject a
   `succeeded` correlator to exercise the four state-(2)-bearing valid
   triples and a `failed` one for the no-fallback scenarios.
5. **Zero reads unless admitted.** `project-shape-observer.ts` receives the
   authority result and the reader; its first statement returns a
   project-shape Unknown (reason from the registry's
   `admissionFailureMapping`, the RFC3-16(a) contradiction attached) when
   `admits` is false. The reader is an injected spy in every test; the read
   count is asserted zero in each of the 195 cases.
6. **Exact state everywhere.** `authority-disclosure.ts` is the only place
   the per-authority state text and the exact state-(1) sentence are
   rendered; Polaris, the home page and `/api/poc` carry the same strings.
   State (1) renders exactly the sentence PWB-REQ-005 quotes; nothing may
   say "verified" for it. Evaluation history is append-only per
   evaluation: a later correlation produces a new evaluation and never
   rewrites an earlier one's recorded state.

## 4. Containment, classification and extraction

- **Read guard** (`git-object-reader.ts`): a path is admitted only if it is
  relative, NUL-free, contains no `.`/`..` segments after POSIX
  normalization, resolves to a `blob` entry (mode `100644`/`100755`) in the
  exact revision's tree — so symlinks (`120000`) and submodules (`160000`)
  are rejected by mode, without touching the working tree — and its
  normalized final segment passes the policy's denied basename, prefix and
  suffix rules. The registry's `resourceLimits` block is an evaluation input:
  source count, per-source and total bytes, index depth, parse time and
  rendered bytes; a breach leaves the source counted and Unknown with reason
  `source-uncaptured-or-unreachable`.
- **Classification** (`content-classification.ts`) follows the policy's
  `classificationOrder` literally over transient bytes: membership in phase
  A seed or phase B manifest → denied path / strict UTF-8 / NUL → every
  detector (the detectors are executed from the policy document's own
  strings, so the policy version is the input) → extraction class assigned
  by the manifest → whole-artifact exclusion on any failure → admit parsed
  facts only. Exclusions carry `{contentDigest, repositoryRelativePath,
  policyId, policyVersion, detectorId | exclusionReason}` with redaction
  class `excluded-artifact` or `unclassifiable-excluded`; `redacted-span` is
  never emitted. Raw bodies are never stored, logged, rendered or served.
- **Extraction** (`project-shape-extraction.ts`): one function per item
  class implementing the spec grammar exactly; keys are literal after NFC;
  any missing heading, malformed row/list/TOML, duplicate key or ambiguous
  leading label makes that source's item denominator Unknown (no partial
  set). Identity is `(item class, declared key)`; path and digest are
  anchor state.
- **Coverage and precedence** (`project-shape-coverage.ts`): the source-path
  denominator comes from Git and phase A and never shrinks; the item
  denominator per admitted source; states modeled / Unknown / contradicted
  summing to D per class. A conflict between two admitted declarations is
  resolved only by a precedence rule that Butlers itself declares and the
  model can cite by source anchor; otherwise both anchors are retained and
  the fact is Unknown with reason `contradicted-pending-adjudication`.
  `[Unknown]` Whether Butlers declares any such rule; the first live run
  answers this and the design's known eight-versus-nine domain-butlers
  conflict is the first fixture either way.

## 5. Model and surfaces

- `PocModel` gains `projectShape` (authority evaluation with per-authority
  state and disclosure, manifest identity, source coverage, items,
  contradictions, exclusions, per-class counts, project-account statements
  with their epistemic tuples) and `walkthroughJudgment`. Epistemic tuples
  reuse cap1-core's `EpistemicState` and six rendering tiers rather than a
  new vocabulary; Unknown reasons are RFC2-24 strings verbatim.
- New provenance kinds: `project-shape-source` (path at revision, blob
  digest) and `owner-act` (record identity, artifact digest, state).
- Polaris renders the seven project-level groups in RFC7 order, then
  capability detail with the existing WhatsApp slice under it (argument /
  contract / reality bands, verbatim requirement text loaded from the
  owning artifact at render, never stored). Every owner-visible string is a
  row in `polaris-copy.ts` with exactly one role; headings ≤ 6 words, ledes
  ≤ 20, prohibited words rejected at test time by an independent extractor.
  The existing "movement" scaffolding is removed from Polaris entirely.
- Every project-shape fact, authority state, judgment state and disclosure
  carries a `data-parity-field` marker so the sweep in §6 can count both
  channels.

## 6. Verification design and denominators

| Denominator | Where | How it is made independent |
|---|---|---|
| 8 valid authority triples | `body-read-authority.test.ts` | hard-coded expected table; fixtures are hand-written act records; the test never imports the validator's case vocabulary |
| 195 invalid admission cases | same file, one `it` per case id | fixture generator mutates one field of a valid triple per case; expected outcome and read-spy count 0 hard-coded; case ids are the spec table rows, not implementation names |
| 84 present-invalid + 2 absent judgment cases | `walkthrough-judgment.test.ts` | same pattern; `verdict-unlawful` literal hard-coded |
| Source denominator and two-extractor agreement (REQ-001/002) | `project-shape-extraction.test.ts` (fixtures) and `project-shape-observer.live.test.ts` (real Butlers, `SYZYGY_POC_BUTLERS_REPO`-gated) | the second extractor is a regex-based implementation written inside the test; Git tree listing is obtained by the test's own `git` call |
| Fault sweep (REQ-003/006) | `content-classification.test.ts`, `git-object-reader.test.ts` | injected faults, sentinel strings, sink scans over model JSON, HTML, logs and state dir |
| Copy oracle (REQ-012) | `polaris-copy.test.ts` | plain text extraction from rendered HTML with an independent word counter and prohibited-term set |
| Parity sweep (REQ-020) | extend `routes.test.ts` into a multiplicity-preserving comparator over every marker class, reporting both channel counts | comparator imports no production vocabulary |
| Anchor covering and non-citability (REQ-014) | `polaris.test.ts` + a static-source sweep for downstream citations of Polaris | expected spans from captured artifacts |

**Mutation proofs** (rule 6; REQ-005/020/022 demand one per case). Each
predicate in the two authority evaluators and each parity marker class
carries a `// mutation-point: <case-id>` comment. For REQ-005 the tool is
`apps/three-surface-poc/src/pwb-mutation.ts` (pure plan) plus
`pwb-mutation-run-main.ts` (`npm run poc:pwb-mutation-run`; tooling, not
shipped behavior). Per mutation it rewrites one predicate's condition to
`false && (…)` (or applies one hand-listed literal mutation: exact-state
collapse/inflation, failed-correlation downgrade, admits-always,
contradiction suppression, history rewrite, duplicate append, forced
"independently verified", altered state-(1) sentence), runs the two
independent test files, requires every named case-instance test to fail,
restores the bytes, verifies the restore by digest, and writes one record
`{id, mustFail, observed, mustFailMissing, killed, restored}` per mutation
with source digests before/after and the commit to
`docs/evidence/pwb-mutation-run-<date>.json`. A run is valid only at a named
commit and is retained as review evidence; it is never run against a dirty
tree.

**Retained evidence** per slice: commit, `vitest run` transcript summary,
the three denominators reported separately, mutation-run file. Claims
without a resolvable record are not made.

## 7. Slices, order and bead mapping

| Slice | Content | Beads | Requirements |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | act-record parser, body-read authority evaluator, governance-inputs loader, authority disclosure; 8 + 195 cases with mutation runner | syzygy-1z3.26 (gate every later slice depends on) | PWB-REQ-005 |
| P2 | read guard, exact-object reader, resource limits; phase A manifest | 1z3.2, 1z3.3, 1z3.4 | PWB-REQ-001, 006 |
| P3 | content classification and exclusions | 1z3.5 | PWB-REQ-003 |
| P4 | extraction grammar, coverage, precedence; live Butlers run (the first lawful body read) | 1z3.6, 1z3.7 | PWB-REQ-002, 004 |
| P5 | model extension, `/api/poc`, epistemic tuples | 1z3.8 | PWB-REQ-001…007, 020 |
| P6 | Polaris project account, copy table, capability detail bands, proposal subordination, anchors, keyboard reachability | 1z3.9…1z3.16 | PWB-REQ-010…016 |
| P7 | verification sweep: parity comparator, mutation runs, contrast/keyboard checks, fresh-checkout demo; walkthrough judgment evaluator | 1z3.17…1z3.21 | PWB-REQ-020, 022 |
| P8 | owner cold-open walkthrough (record + judgment packet), independent review, repair, confirmation, owner report | 1z3.22…1z3.25 | PWB-REQ-021, 022 |

Order P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5 → P6 → P7 → P8. **The first real Butlers body
read happens in P4 and only after P1's evaluator, run against the real
governance tree, reports an all-valid triple.** Until then every live test
runs with the read spy and asserts zero reads. Shared-model changes keep WIP
one; each slice lands with its tests, its mutation evidence where the spec
demands it, and a review at the classes below.

## 8. Risk classes and review bar

| Class | What falls in it | Review bar |
|---|---|---|
| Risk-floor | body-read authority evaluator and loader (REQ-005), read guard and reader (REQ-006), content classification (REQ-003), judgment evaluator (REQ-022), parity comparator (REQ-020) | independent fresh-context review on frozen bytes before merge; mutation evidence attached |
| Ordinary | extraction grammar, coverage, Polaris rendering, copy table | standard review; fixtures pin each grammar class |
| Trivial | tooling, tokens, non-semantic refactors | author-verified |

## 9. Known gaps and assumptions, stated now

- `[Observed]` (closed by P4.4, 2026-09-04) Automated keyboard traversal and
  WCAG AA contrast run in a locally installed Chrome/Chromium through the
  DevTools protocol with no new dependency and no download; where no
  browser is installed the suite is skipped and reported as skipped, and
  `docs/evidence/pwb-p4-4-accessibility-browser-run-2026-09-04.json`
  records the run that was measured. The keyboard-only cold-open
  walkthrough remains the owner's manual evidence.
- `[Observed]` (measured by P4.5, 2026-09-04) At the observed Butlers
  revision the root index and two pillar indexes match the literal grammar;
  the lay-and-land index and 131 other sources are excluded as
  `active-content` under the act-bound policy, and the heart-and-soul index
  is unknown, so the baseline-spec, roster and topology denominators are
  Unknown. The finding is recorded for the 5.x review; it does not license
  grammar or policy changes (those are spec and act amendments).
- `[Observed]` `.syzygy/governance/records/` does not exist yet; it is
  created by the recording session when the first walkthrough record is
  written, per RFC3-15's records category.
- `[Observed]` (2026-09-04) The walkthrough pair is absent: the daemon
  evaluates it as `absent` / Unknown-never-met until the owner performs the
  walkthrough and judgment offered in the P4.6 packet.
- `[Inferred]` The registry entry's `implementationVersion` is `1.0.0`; the
  observer reports that string and the entry's `discoveryVersion` as its
  identities so PWB-REQ-001's deterministic-input stamps match the adopted
  entry byte-for-byte.

## 10. Escalation back to the owner (from the act, restated)

Stop and return to the owner before: any doctrine or contract change; any
amendment to the signed PWB artifacts (including the extraction grammar or
the case tables); any change to security, privacy or retention posture beyond
the adopted policy; any change to the registry entry's constraints or limits;
any read outside the consented repository or content class; any scope beyond
the signed change. Everything else in stack and layout is settled by this
plan and its ordinary revisions.
