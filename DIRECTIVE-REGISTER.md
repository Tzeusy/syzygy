# Directive register — every governing identifier and where it is defined

> **Generated navigation, never authority.** Written by
> `scripts/build_directive_register.py`; regenerate with it, never hand-edit.
> It answers one question — *where is this identifier defined?* — and refuses
> every other. The title column copies only what the corpus marks up at the
> definition site; it is never a clause body and never a paraphrase, and an
> em dash means the corpus marks no title there. To know what a rule **says**,
> open the file and line named here. Where this page and a clause disagree,
> the clause wins.
>
> Which acts are in force is owned by
> [`ACCEPTANCE-ACT-RECORD.md`](.syzygy/governance/decisions/ACCEPTANCE-ACT-RECORD.md)
> and summarised in [`PROJECT-STATUS.md`](PROJECT-STATUS.md). The status line
> under each heading below is a pointer to those, not a second copy of them.

[`PROCESS-GLOSSARY.md`](PROCESS-GLOSSARY.md) defines the identifier *forms* —
what `P-nn`, `RD-nn`, `CG-nn` and the rest mean. This page lists the
*instances*, which that page deliberately does not. Together they answer
"what kind of thing is this?" and "where does it live?"; neither answers
"what does it say?", because only the clause does.

**765 identifiers, 8 families**, recomputed from the files named
in each section every time the generator runs. A family whose files stop
defining its identifiers renders an empty table rather than a stale one.

## Specification-acceptance standard — `CC-SPEC`

**In force.** Confirmed by craft act 6 on 2026-08-17 and amended at CC-SPEC-8 on 2026-09-01, whose act superseded the earlier digest. 11 identifiers, defined across 1 files.

**Read this before citing them.** Defined at a path named `policy-candidates/`, in a file named `…-CANDIDATE.md`, under a head banner that still says it binds nothing. All three are wrong and **none may be corrected**: the act bound these exact bytes. Read the act record, never the package banner (`AGENTS.md`, Governance prose and docs).

| Identifier | Title, as the corpus marks it | Defined at |
|---|---|---|
| `CC-SPEC-1` | Capability and scope are clear | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SPECIFICATION-ACCEPTANCE-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:72 |
| `CC-SPEC-2` | Every requirement names all its material governing warrants | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SPECIFICATION-ACCEPTANCE-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:92 |
| `CC-SPEC-3` | Every requirement has a stable identity | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SPECIFICATION-ACCEPTANCE-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:158 |
| `CC-SPEC-4` | Every requirement is falsifiable in a named form | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SPECIFICATION-ACCEPTANCE-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:171 |
| `CC-SPEC-5` | Non-goals and Unknowns are explicit | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SPECIFICATION-ACCEPTANCE-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:238 |
| `CC-SPEC-6` | No unresolved shape decision is silently selected | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SPECIFICATION-ACCEPTANCE-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:243 |
| `CC-SPEC-7` | Implementation detail appears only when it is required behavior | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SPECIFICATION-ACCEPTANCE-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:261 |

## Shape-to-spec impact rule — `CC-IMPACT`

**In force** by craft act 7, 2026-08-17. 7 identifiers, defined across 1 files.

**Read this before citing them.** Same home and the same three-way mislabelling as `CC-SPEC`. CC-IMPACT-7 additionally names `SHAPE-TO-SPEC-PROPAGATION-FIXTURE-2.md` by path and digest; fixture 3 was added on 2026-08-30 because fixture 2 left `topology[]` unexercised, and neither the clause nor the fixture may be edited to say so.

| Identifier | Title, as the corpus marks it | Defined at |
|---|---|---|
| `CC-IMPACT-1` | Every accepted specification declares what governs it, and the declaration is generated | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SHAPE-TO-SPEC-IMPACT-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:74 |
| `CC-IMPACT-2` | A shape delta performs a reverse-reference sweep, and the trigger set is the warrant set | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SHAPE-TO-SPEC-IMPACT-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:118 |
| `CC-IMPACT-3` | The sweep records four sets, with its denominator and its method | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SHAPE-TO-SPEC-IMPACT-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:145 |
| `CC-IMPACT-4` | Undecidable impact renders as Unknown or contradiction, never as unaffected | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SHAPE-TO-SPEC-IMPACT-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:181 |
| `CC-IMPACT-5` | Every required amendment names its actor, and the sweep names one too | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SHAPE-TO-SPEC-IMPACT-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:188 |
| `CC-IMPACT-6` | Affected specs move in the same logical change. There is no exception today | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SHAPE-TO-SPEC-IMPACT-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:206 |
| `CC-IMPACT-7` | The path is exercised before it is relied on | `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/policy-candidates/SHAPE-TO-SPEC-IMPACT-POLICY-CANDIDATE.md`:242 |

## Recorded owner decisions — `SDR`

**Recorded** — binding, not digest-bound. 37 identifiers, defined across 1 files.

**Read this before citing them.** These carry no title. The corpus marks each with the review finding or pending question it answers (`(R-12)`, `(P-40)`), which is what the title column shows. A ⚑ flag on that tag means the owner decided narrower or wider than the review recommended — open the entry to see which way.

## Design contract clauses (candidate) — `RFC-candidate`

Candidate — **binds nothing.** RFC-0010 and RFC-0011, plus the candidate copies of the accepted modules. 341 identifiers, defined across 32 files.

**Read this before citing them.** A clause number appearing in both this family and the accepted one is the same clause in two homes. The accepted copy governs.

## Cited without a definition site

Every identifier above was found at a **heading or a leading bold run** —
the two places this corpus marks a definition. The identifiers below appear
in their family's own files but never at such a site. Three different things
produce that, and the register does not guess which:

- a **cross-family citation** — an RFC-0003 clause naming an RFC-0001 clause
  is a citation, and the definition sits in the other module (verification
  rule 5: a citation is not a reliance);
- a clause defined in **running prose** rather than at a marked-up site,
  which is a markup gap, not a missing rule;
- a genuine **dangling reference** to a clause that no longer exists.

Resolving one means opening the citing line, not trusting this table.

| Identifier | Family it was cited in |
|---|---|
| `RFC10-16` | Design contract clauses |
| `RFC11-12` | Design contract clauses |

## What this page will not tell you

It does not say what any clause requires — that is the clause's job, and
keeping the body out of this page is the whole reason it is safe to generate.
It does not say which identifiers a task must load;
`.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/TASK-ROUTER.md` routes by task. It
does not define the identifier forms; `PROCESS-GLOSSARY.md` does. It does not
say what is in force beyond naming each family's home and status;
`PROJECT-STATUS.md` and the act record own that. And it resolves no
disagreement between two homes: it shows you both and leaves the
contradiction visible, which is what CC-REV-3 asks for.
