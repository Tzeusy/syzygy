# Security

## Scope

**Nothing here is deployed, and nothing here is released.** No service of
this project runs on any host the reader does not start themselves, and no
build of it has been published anywhere.

**But this repository is no longer only documents.** It now carries a
runnable local daemon, a bounded local POC, and 224 tracked TypeScript and
JavaScript files across five packages and two apps. A reader who runs
`npm install` and `npm run build` is executing this project's code on their
own machine, and that is a real attack surface even though nothing is
deployed. Executable content, disclosed in full:

- **TypeScript under `packages/` and `apps/`**, built and run through the
  npm workspaces declared in `package.json`. `packages/cap1-daemon` binds an
  HTTP listener on loopback and serves both a browser page and a
  credential-gated machine endpoint; `apps/three-surface-poc` and
  `packages/three-surface-poc-core` are the bounded Three-Surface POC.
  `npm run poc` starts them. Nothing starts on its own.
- **`npm run poc:pwb-mutation-run` and `poc:pwb-mutation-sweep` rewrite
  source files in place** while they run — a working-tree effect, not a
  read-only check. Do not run either over uncommitted work.
- **`npm test`, `npm run test:system` and `npm run typecheck`**, which
  execute this project's own code. `test:system` starts the daemon;
  its fresh-clone case is gated behind `SYZYGY_FRESH_CLONE=1` and does not
  run by default.
- **Third-party npm dependencies** resolved from `package-lock.json`. This
  project pins the lockfile and does not audit its transitive tree.
- **Two GitHub Actions workflows** — `.github/workflows/governance-docs.yml`
  (the documentation checks below) and `.github/workflows/node-ci.yml` (build
  and test on Node 24) — both on push and pull request to `main`.
- **Python validation scripts** under `scripts/` and
  `.syzygy/governance/contracts/candidates/scripts/`, stdlib-only. The
  `check_*`/`verify_*` scripts and every generator's `--check` and
  `--selftest` modes are read-only; a generator run **without** `--check`
  writes its derived file.
- **Tracked git hooks under `.beads/hooks/`** (Beads issue-tracker
  integration). **Cloning never activates them** — `git clone` does not
  install hooks.
- **`.claude/settings.json`**, which runs `bd prime` on session start for
  anyone opening the repository in Claude Code.

*Superseded, dated:* until 2026-09-06 this section opened "**Syzygy has no
running software, no deployed service, and no released artifact.** There is no
product attack surface today", and its disclosure list named only the hooks,
one workflow, the Claude settings file and the Python scripts, closing
"Nothing else in this repository executes." That was true when written on
2026-08-05. It stopped being true on 2026-08-21, when Capability 1
implementation was authorized, and again on 2026-08-29 with the POC — and the
page was not restated for either. A security disclosure that lists a
repository's executable content has to be re-derived when the repository grows
code, not left to age behind its own confidence.

## Committed posture

The security rules the project has already adopted are doctrine
**SEC-1…SEC-5** in
[`.syzygy/governance/doctrine/security.md`](.syzygy/governance/doctrine/security.md).
**That file is the authority; this table is a faithful summary, and where
they differ, doctrine wins.**

| Rule | Summary |
|---|---|
| **SEC-1 — Authenticated by default** | Endpoints reachable unauthenticated only on loopback, and client classes distinguished even there: browser requests pass origin/CSRF checks including on loopback; non-browser clients are admitted only through an explicit machine-client mechanism; location never proves identity. Any exposure beyond localhost requires authenticated, TLS-protected access limited to the owner's devices |
| **SEC-2 — Egress through consent** | Governed-project content — including anything derived from it, prompts included — leaves owner-controlled infrastructure only under explicit, recorded, per-project consent naming the permitted providers and the content classes that may be sent. Model providers are such services; providers not named require fresh consent, and remote backing dependencies are permitted under the same consent rule. Absent consent, the inferred layer renders Unknown rather than being computed |
| **SEC-3 — Observed code is untrusted, everywhere** | Observed-project code executes only inside an explicit opt-in execution profile — default-deny, isolated credentials, declared network access, resource limits, and destructive-operation gates — untrusted regardless of who owns the project. No observed code executes at all until the profile contract is accepted |
| **SEC-4 — Writes consented, attributed, revertable** | Syzygy writes into a governed repository only after recorded per-repository consent; every write is attributed, atomic, and individually revertable; existing governance artifacts it did not author are never overwritten without surfacing the conflict |
| **SEC-5 — Secrets never indexed** | Observation applies a declared secret-detection policy; matching content is excluded and the exclusion rendered; unclassifiable content fails closed — excluded, not indexed. A secret in any surface, store, or endpoint is a trust-floor violation |

These are floors an implementation may strengthen and may never weaken,
waive, or temporarily bypass; changing them is an owner doctrine amendment.

## Reporting

Nothing of this project is deployed, so there is no production incident to
report. What can be reported is a defect in what a reader runs locally — in
the daemon, the POC, the test harness, or the tooling above. If you find a
**governance-level**
security defect — a rule that would permit an unsafe implementation, a
contradiction between security rules, or a gap a first implementation could
fall through — please open a GitHub issue describing both readings.
Governance defects are cheapest to fix before they become code. A dedicated
security contact address arrives with the first deployable artifact.

## What this project does not claim

- It does not claim to be secure. The code here has had no security review,
  no dependency audit and no penetration testing; the daemon's loopback
  posture and its origin, CSRF and machine-client checks are asserted by their
  own conformance tests and by nothing independent. *(Until 2026-09-06 this
  bullet read "nothing exists to be secure" — written before any code
  existed.)*
- It does not claim its governance records are independently verified:
  records in this tree sit within the write reach of the actors they govern.
  The project states that gap (see the acceptance record's two-state
  provenance model) rather than hiding it.
